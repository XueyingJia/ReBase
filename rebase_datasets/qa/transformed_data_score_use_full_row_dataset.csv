"Question: What is the purpose of the serialVersionUID in Java serialization? Context: Serialization is the process of converting an object into a stream of bytes to store the object or transmit it to memory, a database, or a file.

When an object is deserialized, the JVM checks the serialVersionUID of the class against the serialVersionUID stored with the serialized object. If the values do not match, the deserialization will fail, preventing the object from being restored in an incompatible way. Transient local variables are not serialized, as they are not part of the persistent state of the object. The serialization process focuses on serializing the instance variables of the class, not the local variables within its methods.",serialVersionUID
