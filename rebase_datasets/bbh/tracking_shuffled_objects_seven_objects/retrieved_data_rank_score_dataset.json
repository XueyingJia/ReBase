Jack picked a handful of red flowers.  \"Mom is going to love these!\" he said.  Jenny picked a handful of purple flowers.  \"These are perfect for mother,\" She thought.  Alice picked two handfuls of yellow flowers.  \"Yellow flowers are so pretty for mom's kitchen,\" she said.  John looked and looked, but couldn't find any blue flowers.  He looked along the road, but there were no blue flowers.  He looked by the stream, but there were no blue flowers. He was very sad.  They walked along the road toward home to give their flowers to their mother.  John walked very slowly and hung his head because he didn't have any flowers to give his mother.  As they neared their home, John saw a small bunch of blue flowers growing near the fence.  He was so happy he picked them all and rushed to catch up with his brother and sisters.  When they got home they gave their mother all the flowers they had picked.  She thanked them and put them on her kitchen table.  \"I have the most thoughtful children in the world,\" She said.",

One evening, after a big meal of chicken and potatoes at Molly's house the girls went outside to play hide and go seek. They almost turned back because they thought they saw a wolf. Luckily, it ended up being a shadow from an old boot. Jessica counted to fifty to give Molly time to hide. In the middle of counting, Jessica heard a sound! Jessica opened up her eyes to see Molly had found a puppy! The puppy had a bell on its collar, so the girls knew it must belong to someone. They carried the puppy back to Molly's house instead of playing hide and go seek. As soon as they got to Molly's front door, Molly's neighbor saw them and screamed with joy. The puppy ran over to Molly's neighbor and licked her face. The neighbor thanked the two girls by giving them each a folded five dollar bill.

As she got deeper into the woods she came to a place that had a lot of flowers.  There were beautiful lilies growing around the edge of a pond.  There were some deer drinking water from the pond.

There were birds building a nest in the bushes.  Under the bush she saw a paper cup that someone had left. There were beautiful butterflies on the bush, too. The sun was warm so she lay down to rest under the shade of a tree.  She fell asleep and as she was sleeping she had a bad dream.  She dreamed that as she was walking through the woods. In her dream she tripped over a log and hurt her ankle.  She started to cry because she was afraid that nobody would miss her and she would have to sleep in the woods.

        "Bobby got a big surprise when he came home from school one day. He found an angel in his room. His grandma had always told him angels were real. Bobby had not believed her when she told him stories. She had also told him stories about mermaids, Bigfoot, leprechauns, and other things. Now, he knew at least one thing she had told him was true. He thought angel wings had to be white. This angel's feathers were many colors. They were red, blue, and green. No white ones that he could see. They looked at each other without speaking. Then, the angel began to talk. He told Bobby he had to listen to his grandma, and believe her stories. Bobby said he would. Bobby asked the angel what it was like to fly. The angel told Bobby it could show him. Bobby would have to beat it at a game. Bobby hoped it would be checkers or chess. His dad had taught him those. He was also good at card games. Instead, the angel wanted to play rock-paper-scissors. Bobby beat the angel two out of three times, so he won. Bobby and the angel then went for a long ride. After they flew, the angel dropped Bobby back at home. It told Bobby he had to promise not to tell anyone. Bobby asked if that included his grandma, mother, brother, and father.

        "There were four brothers that lived together in a small house on the east side of town.  The brothers' names were Bob, Billy, Bryan and Baker.  Each brother was one year in age.  The oldest brother Bob was nine, the second eight, the third seven and the youngest was only six.  Each boy also had something that they were good at that no one else could do.  Baker, the youngest boy was good at magic tricks. Bob was the basketball star, Billy was great at football and Bryan was good at baseball. Each boy liked to watch the others show off their skills.  One afternoon Baker put on a magic show.  For this trick he would need three things.  First, he needed four cups each a different color.  The cups colors were green, yellow, blue, and white.  He would need one white ball and two helpers which the parents happily volunteered for.  He started by showing his brothers the inside of each cup as well as the normal white ball.  He then placed the white ball inside the white cups and moved them around really fast.  Next his parents covered the four cups with a magic blanket.  Baker said some magic words and then his helpers removed the blanket.  To his brothers amazement there were only the three colored cups left.  Each brother got to look under a cup.  After flipping up each cup they saw that there was no white ball.  Just a single green ball inside the green cup!  How did you do that they yelled!  A magician never gives up his secrets.",

        "Billy always loved blueberries. They were his favorite fruit. Today he was going to make juice with his uncle. His uncle liked to make juice out of everything. He made carrot juice, apple juice, vegetable juice, and more juices. He had never made blueberry juice before though!\nFirst, Billy and his uncle went to a blueberry farm. They were each given a basket. They picked for an hour and got several pounds. It was hard work picking the little berries from the trees. Now Billy understood why they were expensive in the store.\nNext, they had to wash the fruit. Some of them still had leaves. Those had to be pulled off. Then the bad berries had to be thrown away. They washed the berries and made them air-dry.\nAfter that, they pushed the blueberries through a strainer . The strainer caught most of the seeds and skins, and only left a small glass of dark purple juice to _ \nWhen they tasted the juice, it wasn't very sweet. Billy's uncle didn't want to add white sugar to the juice. It was better to use a naturally sweet juice, like apple juice, pear juice, or grape juice. They used grape juice as a sweetener  , because grapes had a similar color to the blueberries.\nFinally, they could drink it. It was a lot of work to make juice, but it sure was refreshing!",

She would eat some of the pies, and give the rest of them away to her friends and family. She went out to her back yard where the apple trees were, and started picking. A few hours later, she had enough to make dozens of pies. She walked into the kitchen with her apples, and was all ready to start baking when she saw she was all out of flour. She would have to go to the store to get some, since you can't make a pie without flour. While she was at the store, she would also buy some cheese, bread, and milk. She did not need these to make pie, but she did need them to make her dinner. At the store Jill ran into her friends Bob and Steve and George, and told them she would make them all pies. After she had finished her shopping, Jill went to the library to get some books, to the car wash to wash her car, and to her mother's house to say hello.

        "Toby, an 11-year-old boy, is playing with a ball. The ball goes into the street and Toby runs for the ball. A car hit  Toby.\nAn ambulance takes Toby to the hospital in 30 minutes. The doctors at the hospital tell Toby's parents, \"Toby is in a coma.\" Every day Toby's parents visit him at the hospital. They sit next to Toby's bed and talk to him. But Toby never talks to them. He just sleeps.\nOne day, Toby's father says ,\" Wake up, Toby. Wake up, come home and play with Rusty.\" Rusty is Toby's dog.\nWhen Toby's father says 'Rusty', Toby moves his arm. \"Rusty!\" Toby's father says again. Again, Toby moves his arm .\nToby's parents have an idea. They tell the nurse, \"We want to bring Toby's dog to the hospital.\" The nurse says \"OK\".\nThe next day, Toby's parents bring Rusty to the hospital. When they put the dog on Toby's bed, Toby opens his eyes and hugs the dog.\nToby's parents bring Rusty to the hospital every day. One day Rusty jumps onto Toby's bed and scratches his arms. Toby says his first words \"Bad dog!\".\nAfter eight weeks, Toby is well. He leaves the hospital and goes home.",

        "Bob is a young child who eats potatoes. He normally wakes up around 7 in the morning. He\\newlinehas a dog named Gob. Gob is a very smart dog. Bob also owns a farm. He grows potatoes on\\newlineit. One day he went out with his dog to go check on the farm. There they found a wild\\newlineduck, a cat, and a pumpkin. Gob started to chase the duck. The duck flew away. Gob started\\newlineto get hungry. Gob then ate the pumpkin. Bob got mad at Gob for eating the pumpkin. Bob\\newlinethen threw Gob into the house. Bob then grabbed a bucket. He started to collect as many\\newlinepotatoes as he could find. Bob loved potatoes. He collected around 600 potatoes! Bob\\newlinestarted to run out of room for all the potatoes he found. He then started to eat as many\\newlineas he could. In 1 hour he ate 100 potatoes! He got so full he took a nap. When he awoke he\\newlinefound the cat eating all the potatoes! The cat ate 200 potatoes before Bob awoke. However,\\newlineBob was too full and fat to move. The cat laughed and wanted to eat the potatoes\\newlineagain. Just then, Gob comes running out to chase the cat away! The cat was too fat to run\\newlineaway. It had eaten too many potatoes! Gob grabbed the cat with his teeth and tossed the\\newlinecat down a well. Gob became a hero for saving the potatoes! Bob now lets Gob eat whatever\\newlinehe wants, including pumpkins! Gob is a very happy dog now!",

Scott wanted to have a little fun. He also wanted to adventure with Boscoe. Scott had got done eating breakfast and wanted to ride his bicycle. Boscoe was walking and Scott was riding his bicycle down by the park very close to the river near Scott's house. He wanted to do a little adventuring. Boscoe was walking next to the shore and started barking his head off! Scott wasn't sure what he was barking at, so he got off his bicycle and ran down into the river to see what all the noise was about. \\newline\\newlineAll of the sudden, Boscoe fell in the water and was taken down stream with the fast water. Scott yelled, \"Boscoe!\" and he was off. He jumped into the water and began swimming after Boscoe. Boscoe's little legs were doggy paddling as fast as they could, but had no hope! Finally, Scott caught up to him, but he couldn't get back to the side of the river!\\newline\\newlineAs Scott was thinking this was the last of him and Boscoe, a large stick from a fallen log was well in reach and Scott grabbed it and using all of this might, he pulled him and Boscoe out of the river. \\newline\\newline\"Boy, was that close!\" Scott yelled out loud!\\newline\\newlineThat was the best adventure ever!",

        "Molly and her friend Jessica liked to play hide and go seek in the woods.  They would almost always play in the woods behind Molly's house. They liked to play there because of the giant trees, which were more fun to play in at nighttime. One evening, after a big meal of chicken and potatoes at Molly's house the girls went outside to play hide and go seek. They almost turned back because they thought they saw a wolf. Luckily, it ended up being a shadow from an old boot. Jessica counted to fifty to give Molly time to hide. In the middle of counting, Jessica heard a sound! Jessica opened up her eyes to see Molly had found a puppy! The puppy had a bell on its collar, so the girls knew it must belong to someone. They carried the puppy back to Molly's house instead of playing hide and go seek. As soon as they got to Molly's front door, Molly's neighbor saw them and screamed with joy. The puppy ran over to Molly's neighbor and licked her face. The neighbor thanked the two girls by giving them each a folded five dollar bill. The girls were very excited that they helped save the day!",

I mixed it in with the cake mix, and put it on the table. Then I went to turn on the oven.\\newline\\newlineThen, a bad thing happened! My friendly old cat Billy jumped up to smell the mix!

        "Ashley woke up bright and early on Friday morning during summer.  Her birthday was only a day away, and her parents had promised her a trip to the fair as her present the next day!  She thought it was going to be quite a treat.  She skipped down the stairs to see her mom making a chocolate cake on the stove.  \"You run along outside to go play with your friends,\" her mom told her, \"I can get everything ready for your special lunch on my own.\"  \\newlineWhen Ashley made it outside, she found her friend Katherine playing in the dirt.  When Ashley came closer, she saw that in the dirt were a bunch of insects.  Katherine loved finding and collecting different ones for her insect collection.  Ashley thought it was kind of gross personally, but she sat down next her anyways.\\newline\"Happy birthday, Ashley,\" Katherine yelled when she saw her best friend.\\newline\"Thank you,\" Ashley answered, \"Do you want to go up to the playground until it's time for lunchtime?  Mom says you're invited to come by the way.\"\\newlineKatherine nodded, and the two spent a fun morning playing on the playground.  Once lunchtime came, the two walked back to Ashley's house.  She could picture how many of her favorite foods her mom had most likely made, and she could almost taste the spaghetti on her tongue.  Lunch was ready when they arrived, and it was delicious!  The chocolate cake her mom made was an extra special treat.  She couldn't wait to go to the fair tomorrow!",

        "At night, the magical chipmunks come out to play in the woods. They shower in bowls, and take pictures with their phones. They brush their teeth until they twinkle. They hide in the bushes and play games. There is one game they really like. To play, one chipmunk puts his ear on the phone, and another hides in the woods with a different phone. One chipmunk walks through the woods looking for the hiding chipmunk. The hiding chipmunk tells 'hot' or 'cold' to the first one on the phone. If 'hot', he is very close to finding! If 'cold', he's very far away! Chipmunks love to be hot, so there is a twist to this game! These magical chipmunks can change the temperature with their voice, so if the hiding chipmunk says cold, all the chipmunks becomes colder. If the hiding chipmunk says 'hot', all the chipmunks become hotter. Oh, how the chipmunks love to play this game! But they don't like to lose!",

They liked to play there because of the giant trees, which were more fun to play in at nighttime. One evening, after a big meal of chicken and potatoes at Molly's house the girls went outside to play hide and go seek. They almost turned back because they thought they saw a wolf. Luckily, it ended up being a shadow from an old boot. Jessica counted to fifty to give Molly time to hide. In the middle of counting, Jessica heard a sound! Jessica opened up her eyes to see Molly had found a puppy! The puppy had a bell on its collar, so the girls knew it must belong to someone.

        "There were four brothers that lived together in a small house on the east side of town.  The brothers' names were Bob, Billy, Bryan and Baker.  Each brother was one year in age.  The oldest brother Bob was nine, the second eight, the third seven and the youngest was only six.  Each boy also had something that they were good at that no one else could do.  Baker, the youngest boy was good at magic tricks. Bob was the basketball star, Billy was great at football and Bryan was good at baseball. Each boy liked to watch the others show off their skills.  One afternoon Baker put on a magic show.  For this trick he would need three things.  First, he needed four cups each a different color.  The cups colors were green, yellow, blue, and white.  He would need one white ball and two helpers which the parents happily volunteered for.  He started by showing his brothers the inside of each cup as well as the normal white ball.  He then placed the white ball inside the white cups and moved them around really fast.  Next his parents covered the four cups with a magic blanket.  Baker said some magic words and then his helpers removed the blanket.  To his brothers amazement there were only the three colored cups left.  Each brother got to look under a cup.  After flipping up each cup they saw that there was no white ball.  Just a single green ball inside the green cup!  How did you do that they yelled!  A magician never gives up his secrets.",

As she turned the corner, she came upon a frog who had badly hurt his leg trying to jump over a puddle.  The kitten looked down at the frog and asked him if he needed any help.  The frog said, \"Oh, yes.  My name is Sammy.  I'm late for a very important meeting with my father, Ralph.  I was trying to jump over this puddle and caught my leg on that rock.\"  The kitten bent down and helped the frog climb on to her back.  She carried the frog all the way in to the city, to the place where he was to meet his father.  When the kitten entered the great room with the frog on her back, all of the frogs that were inside looked on in fear.  The frog quickly explained to them how kind and brave the young kitten had been in helping him make it to his meeting.  As it turned out, the frog was actually a prince and today was the day that his father was to pass rule on to him.  In reward for helping him, the new frog king made the kitten a princess, and they lived happily ever after as the best of friends.",

He liked to plant pumpkins, peppers, and tomatoes. He hated peas and broccoli, so he never planted them. He liked zucchini and spinach, but he didn't have any of those plants to plant. One day Tom got a call on his phone. He picked it up and asked who it was. The voice on the other end of the line said, \"It's me, Rachel.\" Tom was so surprised he almost dropped the phone. He said, \"Rachel, is it really you? I can't believe it.\" Rachel said that she had been thinking about Tom and she wanted to make up for their fight. Tom was so happy.

As she got deeper into the woods she came to a place that had a lot of flowers.  There were beautiful lilies growing around the edge of a pond.  There were some deer drinking water from the pond.  She picked some lilies for her mother, the queen.  The lilies were white and yellow and red.  She picked 12 lilies for her mother.  Lizzie also saw mushrooms growing in the woods.  There were birds building a nest in the bushes.  Under the bush she saw a paper cup that someone had left. There were beautiful butterflies on the bush, too. The sun was warm so she lay down to rest under the shade of a tree.  She fell asleep and as she was sleeping she had a bad dream.  She dreamed that as she was walking through the woods. In her dream she tripped over a log and hurt her ankle.  She started to cry because she was afraid that nobody would miss her and she would have to sleep in the woods.

        "Today is the big day, today is Saturday and it is my birthday party.  I turned 7 on Thursday, but I wanted my party on the weekend.  All week my daddy and mommy helped me plan and now it is finally time for fun.  We got a clown and I got to invite all of my friends!  The clown's name was Bob and he was really funny.  Bob made us all laugh a lot.  After the clown left we all played fun games.  We played with a toy filled with candy and all got to eat it.  There were Twix Bars, Milky Ways, M&Ms and Tootsie Rolls.  My favorite candy is Twix so I was very happy to see them inside.  After that, my mom came out with my cake.  It was chocolate with chocolate icing!  Everyone loved it and we even got to eat ice cream too. We were going to eat hamburgers and hot dogs but my dog ate them all before we could. I wish we could have gone swimming in my pool, but it was too cold.  My dad said it was okay but my mom did not want us to get sick.  It was way better than any party I ever dreamed about.  After cake all my friends had to leave except for Timmy.  Timmy's mom said he could sleep over so we made a fort inside and told ghost stories.  My birthday party was the best day of my life.",

        "There was once an animal named Eddy. He was not a dog, a bunny or a bear but a little kitten. Unlike the black, white and orange cats in his neighborhood, Eddy was a gray cat. He loved to go outside and run around the streets and the city. He liked to listen to the birds chirp and watch the children draw with chalk. He was a very smart and friendly kitten.\\newline\\newlineEddy was good at many things. He was good at hopping, running and playing. The thing Eddy was best at was climbing! His claws gripped trees hard which made it easy for him to pull himself up. Anyone who saw Eddy climb might think he was part monkey!\\newline\\newlineEddy also loved his family. When he wasn't outside he liked to sit with people when they would read, play with toys and eat. Eddy was a very lazy cat! He loved to sleep most of the day, at least 12 hours! His family could always count on him to be sleepy.",

She picked some lilies for her mother, the queen.  The lilies were white and yellow and red.  She picked 12 lilies for her mother.  Lizzie also saw mushrooms growing in the woods.  There were birds building a nest in the bushes.  Under the bush she saw a paper cup that someone had left. There were beautiful butterflies on the bush, too. The sun was warm so she lay down to rest under the shade of a tree.  She fell asleep and as she was sleeping she had a bad dream.  She dreamed that as she was walking through the woods. In her dream she tripped over a log and hurt her ankle.  She started to cry because she was afraid that nobody would miss her and she would have to sleep in the woods. She heard someone calling her name and was very happy to see her father standing near her. When she opened her eyes she also could see her brother Henry standing near her.  She could hear their dog, Daisy, rushing to meet them, too.",

All week my daddy and mommy helped me plan and now it is finally time for fun.  We got a clown and I got to invite all of my friends!  The clown's name was Bob and he was really funny.  Bob made us all laugh a lot.  After the clown left we all played fun games.  We played with a toy filled with candy and all got to eat it.  There were Twix Bars, Milky Ways, M&Ms and Tootsie Rolls.  My favorite candy is Twix so I was very happy to see them inside.  After that, my mom came out with my cake.  It was chocolate with chocolate icing!  Everyone loved it and we even got to eat ice cream too. We were going to eat hamburgers and hot dogs but my dog ate them all before we could. I wish we could have gone swimming in my pool, but it was too cold.  My dad said it was okay but my mom did not want us to get sick.  It was way better than any party I ever dreamed about.  After cake all my friends had to leave except for Timmy.  Timmy's mom said he could sleep over so we made a fort inside and told ghost stories.  My birthday party was the best day of my life.",

        "Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation(APEC) members met in Beijing from November 5 to 11 to discuss the future of APEC and the overall development of the Asia-Pacific area. APEC, which was set up  in 1989,is a forum  for 21  member countries to develop free trade and economic cooperation throughout the Asia-Pacific area.\nThough Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation came to a successful close, the \"APEC Blue\" has become popular in Beijing, even in China. A clear blue sky in Beijing is difficult to see during the smog  season, so Beijingers gave it a name: \"APEC Blue\".\n\"Oh, how beautiful the autumn sky is and how fresh the air is!\" This is how most Beijingers feel during APEC. \"I hope the APEC Blue will remain, and I believe, through the efforts we continue to make, it will.\"\nA lot of environmentally friendly ways were taken to reduce  the Beijing smog during the APEC meeting, including limiting the number of cars on the road, stopping some factories in neighboring cities and so on.\nPerhaps we can learn something from London, where the Great Smog killed 4,000 people :in four days in 1952. Britain then passed its first air pollution act, which required that all power plants in London should be shut down, factories must build taller chimneys, and the heating system must be improved.\nIn order to keep \"APEC Blue\", Beijing plans to build air corridors  to blow away pollution. Not all agree with this way. Song Guojun, a professor  of _  at Renmin University, believes that this way will not solve the problem at its root, and only by controlling the source  of pollution will Beijing see bluer skies.",

One day a man named John came by. Mary hid behind a tree when\\newlineshe saw him. Buddy tried to tell her it was okay, but she was too scared to listen. So\\newlineBuddy went out to say hello to John. John was very nice and he liked the same games as\\newlineBuddy. Mary watched Buddy chase after a ball John threw. She could tell John was a nice\\newlineman. She wanted to play too. Buddy saw her watching and led his new friend over to\\newlineMary. John waved to Mary and brought her a flower. Mary smiled at him. She thought he was\\newlinevery kind and she wasn't as nervous as before. Buddy barked happily. Yay for new friends!",

The first demands exact careful movements of the muscles. This kind of activity must be strictly controlled because even a slight movement in the wrong direction will lead a mistake. To type quickly, for example, a person needs training; the slightest movement of a finger in the wrong direction may cause a spelling mistake. A dancer who has to dance on the point of her shoes or turn around on one foot must be trained for a long period of time before she can sense her own center and balance herself. You may have seen a girl walking on a rope across an empty space, which, too, requires a lot of practice. The second kind of physical activity needs greater strength or extra effort. Most of us get tired if we try to run half a mile without stopping, but a specially-trained person can do this without much effort. Three years ago, some scientists carried out experiments, which produced meaningful and unexpected results. They wanted to find out whether a certain amount of physical exercise would injure those suffering from heart problems. They selected some male patients and trained them in continuous bicycle riding. They were surprised to find that the harmful effect of given amount of physical effort was actually less on the hearts of these trained patients than on those of the patients who were not similarly trained. This is important because it shows that regular physical exercise enables us to make better use of the oxygen we breathe in and that this training, in fact, reduces the amount of work our hearts do. Many tasks which are hard for untrained people are not hard at all for trained people. \n Question: The first kind of physical activity must be strictly controlled because   _  . \n Options: (A) a mistake in the wrong direction is dangerous to the fingers (B) a wrong movement in a direction will cause no mistakes (C) a movement in the wrong direction will cause a mistake (D) a slight movement of a finger will lead to a mistake.\n\nOutput:",

A recent survey shows that more people are watching him, reading him and studying him than ever before. Consider the recent yearly conference of the Shakespeare Association of America in Washington, where more than 600 people who study or admire Shakespeare from 18 countries took in topics like ''Whither Attribution Studies,'' ''Unpopular Shakespeare'' and ''Sex Me Here,'' a talk on breast-feeding and Lady Macbeth. ''The national media is saying that fewer students' taking Shakespeare,'' Barbara Mowat, the editor of The Shakespeare Quarterly, observed in a speech at the conference. ''But Shakespeare is thriving.'' The association's membership has increased by a third since 1990. The Shakespeare business is so good these days that W. W. Norton is introducing a huge new collections of the plays into the already crowded _ just in time for tomorrow's birthday anniversary. Priced at $44.95, ''The Norton Shakespeare: Based on the Oxford Edition'' runs for 3,420 pages, offering introductions, illustrations and notes and three versions  of''King Lear.'' Today, movies and videos have made the plays even more accessible. Last year, ''William Shakespeare'sRomeo and Juliet'' was No. 1 at the box office when it opened, and it grossed nearly $50 million. In New York in January, crowds lined up in the freezing cold to see Kenneth Branagh's four-hour''Hamlet.''The students select a scene and then have a violent discussion about it.'' Influenced by films, professors are increasingly teaching students by having them perform the plays. \n Question: Why people from 18 countries came to Washington this year? \n Options: (A) To celebrate Shakespeare's 433d birth day only. (B) To watch some plays by Shakespeare as planned. (C) To celebrate Shakespeare's birthday and study his works. (D) To discuss how to teach students using Shakespeare's plays.\n\nOutput:",

Kevin knew that he needed to go have his keys, but the chipmunk ran with an evil smile on its face.  Eventually, the chipmunk ran into its hole that he called home.  Kevin tried everything he could to have the chipmunk come out with his keys, but he couldn't find out how to make the little guy give up.  Finally, Jessica came over and placed a potato chip at the opening to the hole.  In seconds, the chipmunk came out with the keys and dropped them in front of Kevin right before grabbing the chip and running back into the hole.  The chipmunk then went in to have his snack and left Kevin and Jessica alone.  Kevin thought that maybe next time he could go to the park in the early spring or winter so that the chipmunks would be busy sleeping during the cold weather months.  Kevin then said goodbye to Jessica and went home.",

        "On Tuesday evening, Rick wanted to play with his friends at a playground near his house. Rick's mother, Trish, drove him to the playground. Rick met up with Andrew and Chris. Rick ran to the monkey bars. Andrew ran to the slide. Chris ran to the swings. Trish sat on a bench near the monkey bars and read a book. She wanted to finish the book for a long time and wanted to try to finish right now. Around 6 PM, it started to rain. Trish quickly put her book inside of her jacket to keep it dry. Afterwards, she called Rick and his friends over and told them it was time to go. Rick and Andrew ran to Trish to follow her to the car. Chris tried to run to Trish but tripped and fell. He scabbed his knee. He was in a lot of pain. Trish told Rick and Andrew to get inside of the car. She ran to Chris to check on him. Trish had a bandage in her pocket and put it over Chris' scab. She then helped Chris get to the car. The next day, Rick asked Chris if he was okay from the fall at the playground. Chris said he was okay and wanted to go play at the playground again soon.",

After Jessica finished feeding the duck she came inside and heard the telephone ringing. She answered the phone to hear Annie's excited voice say \"Happy birthday grandma!\" Annie said they would be over very soon. Jessica smiled because she loved her family more than anything. She was very excited. She sat back on her rocking chair and waited until her family arrived.",

But she thought it was extra unfair today because she wanted to play with a new toy. The new toy was called Wiggle Giggle and Jill's friends said it was very fun. When Jill ran into her room, she jumped up on her bed. Frowning, she tried to think of a way to get her homework done very quickly. While she was thinking, she unwrapped a brownie and began to eat it. Brownies were her favorite snack and it made her feel a little better. Suddenly, Jill came up with a plan. She jumped down from the bed and stuffed the rest of the snack in her mouth. As she chewed, she opened her toy chest. Jill had to dig way down to the bottom, but she soon found what she was looking for: parts from a few broken toys. Things were looking up! Jill's plan was to build a robot to do her homework. Nothing would get in the way of her plan. It took her hours to finish it, but she was proud of her work. When it was done, she named the robot Mister Sparks. She told it, \"Mister Sparks, do my homework!\" Then Jill had to go eat dinner. After dinner, Jill spent the rest of the night playing Wiggle Giggle. It was so much fun! But Jill got some bad news before going to bed. Mister Sparks had not done any of the homework!",

They became friends and he came to Lena's parents house twice. Last week Lena said to her father, \"I'm going to marry  Watts, Daddy. He was here yesterday.\"\n\"Oh, yes.\" her father answered. \"He's a nice boy, but has he got much money?\"\n\"Oh, no, both of you are the same,\" the daughter answered angrily. I met Watts on the first day of June and the next day he asked me, \"Has your father got much money?\"",

        "Once upon a time, there was an old man named John. John loved to eat peaches. In fact, John's whole family, including his mother Stephanie, his father Bob, and his brother James loved to eat peaches. John would eat peaches in the morning for breakfast, in the afternoon for lunch, and in the evening for dinner. John and his best friend, Rick, shared their love for peaches. One day John and Rick started a peach farm so that they would never run out of their favorite fruit. They planted hundreds of peach trees and waited for them to bear fruit. After 6 years of waiting, 1 lonely peach finally grew on one of the trees John and Rick planted. They picked the peach and brought it home. They waited until the weekend to eat it in case more peaches grew, but none did. John and Rick were sad and confused about their farm. They planted hundreds of trees and were sure that there would be thousands of peaches for them to eat in no time. Another peach never grew on their farm for 17 years. One day, a mighty crack of thunder led to a strong storm. Lightning hit the ground over and over, and John and Rick were scared their trees might be killed. The next morning, every tree on the farm had more than 10 peaches on it. John and Rick started shouting for joy.",

        "There were four brothers that lived together in a small house on the east side of town.  The brothers' names were Bob, Billy, Bryan and Baker.  Each brother was one year in age.  The oldest brother Bob was nine, the second eight, the third seven and the youngest was only six.  Each boy also had something that they were good at that no one else could do.  Baker, the youngest boy was good at magic tricks. Bob was the basketball star, Billy was great at football and Bryan was good at baseball. Each boy liked to watch the others show off their skills.  One afternoon Baker put on a magic show.  For this trick he would need three things.  First, he needed four cups each a different color.  The cups colors were green, yellow, blue, and white.  He would need one white ball and two helpers which the parents happily volunteered for.  He started by showing his brothers the inside of each cup as well as the normal white ball.  He then placed the white ball inside the white cups and moved them around really fast.  Next his parents covered the four cups with a magic blanket.  Baker said some magic words and then his helpers removed the blanket.  To his brothers amazement there were only the three colored cups left.  Each brother got to look under a cup.  After flipping up each cup they saw that there was no white ball.  Just a single green ball inside the green cup!  How did you do that they yelled!  A magician never gives up his secrets.",
