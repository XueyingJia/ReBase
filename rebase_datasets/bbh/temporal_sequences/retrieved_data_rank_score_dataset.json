        "My friend Alice visited my city last week. She arrived on Wednesday morning. She is from Australia. I showed her around the city. We visited the Clock Tower first. The Clock Tower was very tall. We took some photos there. Then we went to City Museum. After that,we saw a good movie. The next day, we visited the Ladies' Street .There were a lot of clothes shops. The clothes were cheap and beautiful. Alice bought some clothes for her parents and friends. Then we went to the Seafood Street. We bought some seafood. We also had seafood in a restaurant. All of us enjoyed the meal. Then we went to a concert in the evening. The music was fantastic!\nOn the third day,the weather was very hot so we decided to visit the Monkey Garden. We found different kinds of monkeys in the Garden. The monkeys were funny and active. Alice went back to Australia on Friday evening. She enjoyed the trip. She invited me to visit Australia next summer.",

Her mother made them biscuits and eggs for breakfast.  The two girls were too excited to sit still.  They didn't even watch any cartoons before they left for the zoo in the car.  The first thing they saw was a zoo worker carrying a pail of fish.  He was going to feed the penguins.  The penguins looked funny walking on land but were very fast swimmers in the water.

One lion was asleep on his back but the others were in a circle eating some meat.  It did not look tasty.

        "Last week when I was sitting in my office,I heard an elderly lady talking on the phone about her husband.Her husband's name was Ed.He dropped her off for her doctor's appointment and was going to park the car and wait for her.She was so upset that she started to cry.I knew I should take action.\nThe lady told me her name was Helen and she called the restaurant she and her husband were going to have lunch at after her appointment to see if he was waiting for her there.She explained that she thought her husband parked the car in the parking lot and waited for her in the car but she didn't find him there so she returned to see if he entered the medical building,but Ed was not there either.She regretted making her husband park the car alone since some signs of Alzheimer's had happened in his behavior.I asked a few nurses to help look for Ed inside and outside the medical building according to Helen's description.Then I offered to drive Helen to the restaurant to see if Ed was waiting for her there.\nOn arriving at the parking lot of the restaurant,Helen began to search for Ed's car but she failed,which suggested Ed wasn't there.We decided to have a talk with the manager before we returned to the hospital.On our way to the manager's office.I received a call from a nurse,who said they had found Ed.What a relief!  But we still needed to go on searching since he forgot where he parked his car! Fortunately, we didn't have much difficulty finding it.\nAs I waved good-bye to the couple, I thought \"This is true love in life.The love is not romantic but it stays with us all the time.\"",

        ".British people are famous for drinking tea. But brother and sister, Sarah and Bobby Green, became young millionaires when they opened a chain of American-style coffee shops in the UK.\nHaving the idea: It started when Sarah took a weekend trip to New York to visit her brother Bobby. One evening, in a Thai restaurant, Sarah told Bobby how much she wished she could buy American-style coffee in London. Bobby suggested they started their own coffee shop. Sarah fell in love with the idea.\nDoing the Research: Back in London, she spent a whole day on the London subway, getting off the train at different stations to taste the coffee. \"It was terrible, and I knew there was a gap   in the market.\" In 1995, they opened their first Coffee Republic shop in central London.\nMaking it work: The first year was very difficult. British people were not used to the names of American coffees, like latte and macchiato. But being successful was their dream and they were not going to give up. Today, there are over 100 Coffee Republic shops all over the country and the company has PS30 million a year.\nAdvice for others: Sarah has now written a best-selling book about their experience, calledAnyone Can Do It ! She hopes it will help other young people to start their own businesses. She says, \"If you think you have the energy, then get out and follow your dream.\"",

I put my heavy bag down on the floor, put the newspaper and chocolate on the table to keep a place, and went to get a cup of coffee.\nWhen I came back with my coffee, there was someone sitting near to me. It was one of those strange-looking young men, with dark glasses, torn clothes, and long hair. But I wasn't surprised at such a young man. What surprised me most was that he had started to eat my chocolate!\nI was rather uneasy about him, but I didn't want to get into trouble. I just looked down at the front page of the newspaper and took a bit of chocolate. The boy looked at me. Then he took a second piece of my chocolate. I could hardly believe it. Still I didn't say anything. When he took a third one, I felt  more angry than uneasy. I thought, \"Well, I shall have the last piece.\" And I got it.\nThe boy gave me a strange look and then stood up. As he left, he shouted out, \"This woman is crazy!\" Everyone looked at me. That was embarrassing  enough. But it was worse when I finished my coffee and ready to leave. It wasn't my chocolate I had eaten a moment before. Mine was just under my newspaper.",

However, Bruce and June wanted to go watch a movie directed by Miranda July. They split up and said they would meet up at the food area later. Three hours later, the friends got back together. Ben and Sasha wanted to leave, so they went back out to the parking lot and got in the car. When June backed out of the parking spot, she scraped the car next to her. Sasha said it was okay, but Bruce said June needed to leave a note for the driver of the other car. Just then, the other driver appeared. They called the police to get an accident report. When the police arrived, they put Ben and Sasha in handcuffs because they had been stealing. They had to volunteer every week until October.",

My heart went down when Miss Chan, our head teacher, said that Matthew and Beth, two students from England, would spend three months with us! I was worried that I had to speak English so much! But at the end of the school day, I was happier than I thought: the morning with them today was more enjoyable than I expected.\nToday is the most unforgettable first day I have had! Matthew is fantastic! His English is clearer and easier to listen to than I thought. The other English student, Beth, is the most helpful girl I've ever met. There were lots of things to do on the first day. Beth offered to help Miss Chan put up all the notices. Of course, some of the credit   should also go to ME because I translated some of the notices for her. Miss Chan praised us!\nWe finished all the preparations 10 minutes earlier than expected, then Beth and I talked for a while, Matthew sang several English songs and did some stand-up comedy   at the party. We all praised him. When the bell rang to end the first school day, none of us wanted to leave.\nWhen I went back home, I had a little headache.

As she lay in bed, Sally couldn't help but think of all the fun things she would be doing the next day. She would build sand castles, splash in the water, and play Frisbee with her older brother, Jared. All of theses thoughts and more raced through her head, until finally she fell asleep. In the early hours of the morning, Sally awoke to her brother making loud noises in her ear. He was so annoying. A little bit later, her mother and father came in the room, helping Sally and Jared get ready for the day. When everyone was dressed and all of their belongings were packed, the whole family set off for a day of fun in the sun. The ride was long and their van was hot and stuffy, even with the windows rolled down. After what seemed like hours, Sally spotted the road sign signaling that the beach was close!

He really wanted to have a pair for his birthday.\nHe sadly walked away and thought of what to tell his mother. He knew she would give him anything if she could. But he also knew very well she had little money. He decided not to go home at once, because he looked worried and he didn't want to make his mother worry about it. So he went to the park and there he sat on the grass. Then he saw a girl in a wheelchair . He found that the girl moved the wheels with her hands. Bill looked at her carefully and he was surprised to see that the girl had no feet. He looked down at his own feet.\"It's much better to be without shoes than without feet,\" he thought. It was not right for him to feel sorry and sad. He went away and smiled. He thought he was luckier in life.",

He was smiling at my Erik.\n\"He might hurt my Erik,\" I thought. Everyone in the restaurant looked at us and the old man. Then we decided to leave. The old man sat between the door and us.\nAs I walked closer to the man, I turned my back. Suddenly, Erik leaned  over my arms, reaching with both arms in a baby's pick-me-up position . Before I could stop him, Erik had escaped  from my arms to the man's. Soon the very old smelly man and my young baby developed a kind of friendship.\nErik put his little hand on the man's face, and I saw the old man closed his eyes and tears running down his face. His aged hands held my baby so gently . A moment later, the old man opened his eyes, passed me my baby and said, \"Thank you, Madam. You've given me the best Christmas gift.\"\nI cried, with my face burning hot. A child saw a soul , but a mother saw only a kind of clothes.",

        "It was time for Jill to make her famous apple pie, out of the yellow apples that grew on her land. It was not time to pick the red cherries, or the orange oranges or even the green lettuce, but their nice colors made Jill happy. She would eat some of the pies, and give the rest of them away to her friends and family. She went out to her back yard where the apple trees were, and started picking. A few hours later, she had enough to make dozens of pies. She walked into the kitchen with her apples, and was all ready to start baking when she saw she was all out of flour. She would have to go to the store to get some, since you can't make a pie without flour. While she was at the store, she would also buy some cheese, bread, and milk. She did not need these to make pie, but she did need them to make her dinner. At the store Jill ran into her friends Bob and Steve and George, and told them she would make them all pies. After she had finished her shopping, Jill went to the library to get some books, to the car wash to wash her car, and to her mother's house to say hello. She went home after, and made her yummy pies.",

The dishes in the picnic included peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, watermelons, potato salad, and chocolate cookies. When they got to the park the father, George, was looking for a good place to have the picnic. While they were walking they bumped into their neighbors, Robert and Natalie, and their twins, Anson and Anne and their dog Emile. Robert explained that it was the twins' birthday and they were celebrating by going out for a walk. They said goodbye and kept looking for a picnic spot. He chose a nice spot under a tree that would keep the family cool. While setting up the picnic, the mother, Barbara, told the son, Ralph to go play with their dog, Scout, to pass some time until it was time for dinner. Ralph found a stick and began to play fetch with Scout down the hill. Some time passed and Ralph began to return to the picnic with Scout. Along the way back he picked a flower to give to his mom because it was Mother's day. When he arrived he gave the flower to his mom and she said, \"Thank you so much, Ralph!\" His mother poured him a cool and tasty glass of lemonade. It tasted extra good because it was so hot outside! Ralph sat down and enjoyed the picnic with his family under the large tree.",

Anna was having trouble getting the kite in the air and was sad. Jason went over to help her and together they got the kite into the air and watched it go higher and higher. Anna let Jason fly the kite for a little bit. After that Jason was hungry. Anna showed him that she had brought a green Picnic basket from her house. Inside the picnic basket there were cakes and sandwiches and salad and some fruit. Jason had brought lemonade in a blue bottle and shared it with Anna. It was the most fun Jason had at the beach.",

On this day, I witnessed   a wonder.\nI was making lunch when I saw my 6-year-old son, Billy, walking very slowly towards the woods. Minutes later he came running out again, towards the house. Soon after, I saw him walking towards the woods again. This went on for an hour. Finally I walked out of the house quietly and followed him.\nBilly cupped   both hands in front of him as he walked, careful not to drop the water he carried. Then I saw an amazing sight. Several large deer stood in front of him. Billy walked right up to them. I saw a baby deer lying on the ground. It was dying of thirst, and it tried to lift its head to drink the water in my boy's hands.\nWhen the water was gone, Billy ran back to the house. I followed him to the kitchen. Billy opened the tap and a small trickle   came out. He let the drips   slowly fill up his \"cup\".\nNow I understood what was going on. The week before, he tried giving water to our horses but I told him not to waste water. Now when he stood up and turned, I was there in front of him. His eyes filled with tears  . \"I'm not wasting,\" he said. I joined him with a small cup of water from the kitchen. I let him walk to the baby deer alone while I stood by the woods. Tears rolled down my face. Suddenly there were some drops falling, as if the sky itself was crying.",

Every day she woke up and went to kindergarten, played outside, and watched movies.  Sometimes her family would go to a rollercoaster park.  Her mom would always try to get her to ride the big rides but she was afraid and wanted to stay in Snoopyland.  For two years she stayed in the little kid section of the park.  Her big brother who had to babysit her was getting mad because she would not try new rides.  She cried more and more until one day she got brave.  She went on a little bigger musical ride that went around in circles pretty fast.  She got off the ride and loved it!  Her mom said to her, \"Okay, let's go on the big kid rides now!\"  Megan was afraid again and cried and cried.  For the rest of that summer she stayed in the little kid section and went on little rides.  The next summer her brother brought his girlfriend home.  His girlfriend's name was Sara and she was older, and loved big rides.  Megan liked Sara a lot and wanted to make her like her.  When Sara asked Megan if she would ride on bigger rides she said yes, and she went on her first real rollercoaster, Thunderhawk.  She was frightened at first but when she stepped off the ride she loved it like she had loved the other ride last year!  Now was the real test.  Sara asked Megan if she wanted to go on the biggest ride in the park.  She was afraid but wanted to show Sara how big she was.  At the beginning of the ride Megan was afraid and was about to start crying when they went down the first big hill.  Her stomach was tickled and she began laughing really loud.  She stepped off the ride with a huge smile on her face and was very proud.  Megan was no longer afraid of the big rides and enjoyed riding them for the rest of her life.",

        "One day there was a six year old little girl named Megan who lived in a big house with her family.  She had two dogs, a brother, a sister, and a mom and dad.  Every day she woke up and went to kindergarten, played outside, and watched movies.  Sometimes her family would go to a rollercoaster park.  Her mom would always try to get her to ride the big rides but she was afraid and wanted to stay in Snoopyland.  For two years she stayed in the little kid section of the park.  Her big brother who had to babysit her was getting mad because she would not try new rides.  She cried more and more until one day she got brave.  She went on a little bigger musical ride that went around in circles pretty fast.  She got off the ride and loved it!  Her mom said to her, \"Okay, let's go on the big kid rides now!\"  Megan was afraid again and cried and cried.  For the rest of that summer she stayed in the little kid section and went on little rides.  The next summer her brother brought his girlfriend home.  His girlfriend's name was Sara and she was older, and loved big rides.  Megan liked Sara a lot and wanted to make her like her.  When Sara asked Megan if she would ride on bigger rides she said yes, and she went on her first real rollercoaster, Thunderhawk.  She was frightened at first but when she stepped off the ride she loved it like she had loved the other ride last year!  Now was the real test.  Sara asked Megan if she wanted to go on the biggest ride in the park.  She was afraid but wanted to show Sara how big she was.  At the beginning of the ride Megan was afraid and was about to start crying when they went down the first big hill.  Her stomach was tickled and she began laughing really loud.  She stepped off the ride with a huge smile on her face and was very proud.  Megan was no longer afraid of the big rides and enjoyed riding them for the rest of her life.",

        "There once was a beautiful princess named Lizzie who lived in a castle in the woods.  One day she went for a walk to see if any of the spring flowers had started to bloom.  Her mother's birthday was the next day.  If there were flowers blooming she would pick some for her mother. Her mother's name was Queen Alice.  As she got deeper into the woods she came to a place that had a lot of flowers.  There were beautiful lilies growing around the edge of a pond.  There were some deer drinking water from the pond.  She picked some lilies for her mother, the queen.  The lilies were white and yellow and red.  She picked 12 lilies for her mother.  Lizzie also saw mushrooms growing in the woods.  There were birds building a nest in the bushes.  Under the bush she saw a paper cup that someone had left. There were beautiful butterflies on the bush, too. The sun was warm so she lay down to rest under the shade of a tree.  She fell asleep and as she was sleeping she had a bad dream.  She dreamed that as she was walking through the woods. In her dream she tripped over a log and hurt her ankle.  She started to cry because she was afraid that nobody would miss her and she would have to sleep in the woods. She heard someone calling her name and was very happy to see her father standing near her. When she opened her eyes she also could see her brother Henry standing near her.  She could hear their dog, Daisy, rushing to meet them, too.",

The company is in the north of the city, and her flat is in the south. But Sally has never been late for work.\nSally is very popular in the company. She is kind to everybody and gets on well with her workmates. They often visit each other after work and talk about almost everything.\nHowever, Sally has made a decision to leave the company. She is going to find a job as a tour guide. \"If I work as a tour guide, I'll be able to meet more people and learn more about China,\" she told her friends.\nLast Friday Sally had a talk with the manager of a travel agency. He seemed pleased with her Chinese. At the end of the talk, the manager said, \"I'll call you up in a week and tell you the result.\" Now Sally is waiting for the answer.",

        "As I was leaving to meet Lynne, my roommate told me that I'd better take some money. But I didn't listen to him. I thought that Lynne would pay because she had invited me. I arrived at the restaurant exactly on time. I'd been told that Americans expect you to be on time. Lynne and I sat at a table in the corner of restaurant and a waitress came and took our order.\nThe dinner was a great success. I talked a lot about Saudi Arabia and Lynne told me all about herself. After two hours, the waitress finally came and asked if we wanted one check or two. Lynne said two. We went to the cashier and Lynne paid her check. I was embarrassed   when the cashier gave me my bill. I had no money to pay for my meal. Then I had an idea. I pretended to look for something in my pockets and said, \"Oh! I forgot my wallet! Can I call my roommate, please?\" The cashier showed me where the phone was and I quickly called my roommate. In a few minutes, he arrived with some money, but he couldn't hide how he felt. He laughed all the way home. Now, I think it's funny too, but at that time I was terribly embarrassed. I thought that an invitation to have dinner in the United States meant the same thing as that in China. I guess you have to understand that your customs are only your customs. When you visit a foreign country, you have to learn about their customs, too.",

        "Sally always loved the ocean. Whenever her parents would talk about going to the beach, she would get so excited that she couldn't sleep the night before. Tonight was one of those nights. As she lay in bed, Sally couldn't help but think of all the fun things she would be doing the next day. She would build sand castles, splash in the water, and play Frisbee with her older brother, Jared. All of theses thoughts and more raced through her head, until finally she fell asleep. In the early hours of the morning, Sally awoke to her brother making loud noises in her ear. He was so annoying. A little bit later, her mother and father came in the room, helping Sally and Jared get ready for the day. When everyone was dressed and all of their belongings were packed, the whole family set off for a day of fun in the sun. The ride was long and their van was hot and stuffy, even with the windows rolled down. After what seemed like hours, Sally spotted the road sign signaling that the beach was close! Sally's mother said that they could stop for some frozen yogurt on the way since it was so hot outside. Sally and Jared both cheered. They pulled up to the shop and went inside, the cool air hitting their faces as they opened the door. There were so many different flavors! Jared always got chocolate, because that was Dad's favorite flavor, too. Mom chose strawberry because it seemed perfect for this hot weather. Sally couldn't choose. She really wanted mint chocolate chip, but they were all out. Finally she chose the shop's special flavor \"Tropical Turtle\". The family left with smiles on their faces, ready to have a great day at the beach.",

She did not need these to make pie, but she did need them to make her dinner. At the store Jill ran into her friends Bob and Steve and George, and told them she would make them all pies. After she had finished her shopping, Jill went to the library to get some books, to the car wash to wash her car, and to her mother's house to say hello. She went home after, and made her yummy pies.",

        "Molly and her friend Jessica liked to play hide and go seek in the woods.  They would almost always play in the woods behind Molly's house. They liked to play there because of the giant trees, which were more fun to play in at nighttime. One evening, after a big meal of chicken and potatoes at Molly's house the girls went outside to play hide and go seek. They almost turned back because they thought they saw a wolf. Luckily, it ended up being a shadow from an old boot. Jessica counted to fifty to give Molly time to hide. In the middle of counting, Jessica heard a sound! Jessica opened up her eyes to see Molly had found a puppy! The puppy had a bell on its collar, so the girls knew it must belong to someone. They carried the puppy back to Molly's house instead of playing hide and go seek. As soon as they got to Molly's front door, Molly's neighbor saw them and screamed with joy. The puppy ran over to Molly's neighbor and licked her face. The neighbor thanked the two girls by giving them each a folded five dollar bill. The girls were very excited that they helped save the day!",

        "Is there a difference in meaning between \"It's too late to telephone. Mary is asleep now.\" and \"It's too late to telephone. Mary will be asleep now.\"?\nYes. The difference is in the reason given for it being too late to telephone. In the first sentence \"Mary is asleep now\", the speaker is stating  a fact. In the second sentence \"Mary will be asleep now\", the speaker is saying what Mary usually does. In fact, it's possible that Mary isn't asleep, but she is usually asleep at this time.\nSo let's take two situations. In the first case, imagine Mary's mother answers the telephone.\nYou: \"May I speak to Mary, please?\"\nMother: \"No. It's too late. Mary is asleep now.\"\nYou: \"Are you sure? It's only 10 0'clock.\"\nMother: \"Yes. I went to her room and she was asleep.\"\nThe mother knows that Mary is asleep because she went into her room and saw her.\nHere is another case. Two friends decide to telephone Mary.\nJack: \"Let's telephone Mary. It's 10 0'clock.\"\nJill: \"No. It's too late. She will be asleep now.\"\nJill knows that Mary always goes to bed before 10 o'clock, so now she'll probably be asleep. But it is also possible that she is staying up late.",

They went to class together, had lunch together, and even went to the washroom together. Having one or two best friends is important, said Xu Zheng, a teacher from Jiangsu. \"Students have secrets.

Then one day, he was told: \"The exam is in 100 days.\" \"We need a strong knowledge base to pass the exam. But I didn't care about it,\" said Zhang.

It said,\"10 pork chops , please.\"So the butcher took the money and put a bag of chops in the dog's mouth.\nThen he quickly closed the shop because he decided to follow the dog. He found the dog on the street. The dog was waiting for a green light. Then the dog walked across the road. The dog went to a bus stop. When a bus arrived, the dog checked the number and then got on the bus.\nAfter a while, the dog stood up on his back paws  to push the \"stop\" button . The bus stopped and the dog got off. Then the butcher followed it to get off the bus.\nThe dog ran to a house and dropped the bag in front of the front door. It then began to beat its head against the front door. After a while, a big man opened the door and began shouting at the dog. The butcher ran up and shouted at the man, \"What are you doing? Your dog is a genius .\"\nThe owner of the dog said, \"Genius? No way! I always tell him to take the keys when he goes to the stores. But he never listens to me!\"",

        "One day there was a six year old little girl named Megan who lived in a big house with her family.  She had two dogs, a brother, a sister, and a mom and dad.  Every day she woke up and went to kindergarten, played outside, and watched movies.  Sometimes her family would go to a rollercoaster park.  Her mom would always try to get her to ride the big rides but she was afraid and wanted to stay in Snoopyland.  For two years she stayed in the little kid section of the park.  Her big brother who had to babysit her was getting mad because she would not try new rides.  She cried more and more until one day she got brave.  She went on a little bigger musical ride that went around in circles pretty fast.  She got off the ride and loved it!  Her mom said to her, \"Okay, let's go on the big kid rides now!\"  Megan was afraid again and cried and cried.  For the rest of that summer she stayed in the little kid section and went on little rides.  The next summer her brother brought his girlfriend home.  His girlfriend's name was Sara and she was older, and loved big rides.  Megan liked Sara a lot and wanted to make her like her.  When Sara asked Megan if she would ride on bigger rides she said yes, and she went on her first real rollercoaster, Thunderhawk.  She was frightened at first but when she stepped off the ride she loved it like she had loved the other ride last year!  Now was the real test.  Sara asked Megan if she wanted to go on the biggest ride in the park.  She was afraid but wanted to show Sara how big she was.  At the beginning of the ride Megan was afraid and was about to start crying when they went down the first big hill.  Her stomach was tickled and she began laughing really loud.  She stepped off the ride with a huge smile on her face and was very proud.  Megan was no longer afraid of the big rides and enjoyed riding them for the rest of her life.",

        "A student newspaper reports that most students go to sleep at 1:30 am. Even if that's an overstatement  , it's close to the truth. Scientists say teens should sleep nine hours each night. But that's hard. Some are even \"pulling all-nighters\"  . These students must hand in their homework the next day but they haven't done it. In the morning they don't look healthy and you can tell who's been doing it. One of my classmates did a survey on the topic. She found that most kids pull all-nighters to finish homework, but some do it for other reasons, such as playing computer games!\nMaybe our lack  of sleep is because of laziness -- I think I'm a rather lazy student -- or maybe it's because we have too much to do in American high schools. I usually go to bed around midnight. If I stayed up past 1:30 am, I wouldn't get any work done. I'd be falling asleep at my computer. My classes begin at 7:30 am. I'm partly awake in my first class. By the second, I'm a little sleepy. By my third class, I'm sleepy. By midday I'm finally fully awake. But by 3:00 pm, I'm slowing down again. Yet I get more sleep than usual students.\nMost American high schools seem to have a similar  problem with sleepy students. High school classes start at 7:30 am, so students have to get up one and a half hours before that to get ready and catch the bus. It's believed that lack of sleep can be bad for both grades and health. Some schools are paying attention. Classes in those schools start at 8:30 am.",

        "Every day since March 8, people all over the world keep asking the same question: Where did Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 go? It turns out to be the biggest mystery in modern aviation   history.\nIn the early hours of March 8, a Boeing 777 took off from Malaysia's capital Kuala Lumpur  . It was heading to Beijing.\nBut about two hours into the flight, the plane lost contact. There were 239 people on board the Malaysia Airlines flight, including 154 Chinese.\nAbout 12 countries, including China, the US and Australia, have joined the search for the missing plane and passengers. The plane's disappearance was a \"mystery\", said officials. The plane was flying at a height of more than 10,000 meters when it suddenly lost contact. The weather was clear. The pilots didn't make any distress calls  . When a plane crashes, broken parts are usually recovered. But up to April 2, officials have not found anything.    People are also talking about a possible hijacking. Interpol   said that two people on the flight used stolen passports. But that information alone isn't evidence  of a hijack.\nThe investigation   is still going on. It could take months or even years to find out what happened to the flight.\n\"We are looking at all possibilities,\" said Malaysian Transport Minister Hishamuddin Hussein. \"The most important thing now is to find the plane.\"\nOn March 24 came a piece of sad news. Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak said that the plane \"ended in the southern Indian Ocean\". Everyone on the plane died. But the mystery is still not solved. Nobody is giving up. China has said it will work hard to find out the truth at all costs.",

Jim was so surprised that he stopped to look at him closely. It was an icy morning and he looked very old.\nThe poor old man didn't have anything to cover himself with. Jim went into his house to get the old man a blanket . However, there were no extra blankets, so Jim thought hard and took his father's coat. It was the only thing of his father's that he had left. Jim wrote a short note. \"Sir, I found you sleeping in front of my house. This is my father's coat. I hope it fits you well.\" He put the note in a pocket of the coat, and covered the old man with the coat. Then he went to work.

After the ants were in the glass farm, they started to make tunnels . I was amazed that each one knew exactly what to do. Each had its own job.\nOn the fifth day a tragedy  happened. I put my face so close to the glass farm that I knocked it over. All the tunnels fell down. Although the ants remained alive after their earthquake, one by one began to die. I was scared as I watched them give up building their tunnels to carry the bodies to a corner the farm. My mother said that the ants were dying of sadness. They simply could not stand that their tunnels were gone.\nAlthough much time has passed, I still think of that ant farm. Mom had hoped it would teach me about the natural world, but it taught me much more.\nOver the years, I came to realize the importance of teamwork. Working together, the ants were able to make an amazing world for themselves. I also learned that they should be admired for their hard work.\nBut there was an even larger lesson that I did not realize until recently: Adversity  is a natural part of life, and must be accepted. Unlike the ants, we cannot give up when we are sad. We have to realize that if a tunnel is gone, we must build another.\nGiving up, I say, is not a good choice.",

Twinkles loved to fly around the forest with her best friend Betsy the Bat. Betsy was a very forgetful bat. One day Twinkles and Betsy were playing next to the bushes by the river bank when Betsy shouted, \"Oh no, I've forgotten my lunch that my mom packed for me today! It is late in the afternoon and I am hungry.\"\\newline\\newline\"Do not worry,\" said Twinkles. \"I am going to wait here for you until you get back.\"\\newline\\newlineWith that, Betsy flew off toward her home in the wet cave near the other end of the river. An hour went by and Betsy still had not returned. \"Hmm,\" thought Twinkles, \"I wonder where Betsy went off to.\" Twinkles flew off to find her best friend.\\newline\\newlineSoon, she heard a voice calling from down below. \"Help me! I'm stuck!\" Twinkles looked down. Sure enough, it was Betsy! She had been caught in a pile of sticky mud near the mouth of the cave. \\newline\\newline\"Don't worry, I am coming to save you!\" cried Twinkles. Twinkles swooped down to the ground. She found a strong stick nearby that she could use to help her pull Betsy out of the thick mud. Betsy grabbed the end of the stick that Twinkles held out to her. After some heavy tugging, Betsy was free.\\newline\\newline\"Thank you so very much for pulling me out of the mud! I was looking for some berries to use for jam down by the river.

        "On Tuesday evening, Rick wanted to play with his friends at a playground near his house. Rick's mother, Trish, drove him to the playground. Rick met up with Andrew and Chris. Rick ran to the monkey bars. Andrew ran to the slide. Chris ran to the swings. Trish sat on a bench near the monkey bars and read a book. She wanted to finish the book for a long time and wanted to try to finish right now. Around 6 PM, it started to rain. Trish quickly put her book inside of her jacket to keep it dry. Afterwards, she called Rick and his friends over and told them it was time to go. Rick and Andrew ran to Trish to follow her to the car. Chris tried to run to Trish but tripped and fell. He scabbed his knee. He was in a lot of pain. Trish told Rick and Andrew to get inside of the car. She ran to Chris to check on him. Trish had a bandage in her pocket and put it over Chris' scab. She then helped Chris get to the car. The next day, Rick asked Chris if he was okay from the fall at the playground. Chris said he was okay and wanted to go play at the playground again soon.",

        "That warm day was the only day of the week without rain. I opened the door, took a seat and began to enjoy the wonderful sunshine. Suddenly, I noticed that the house near mine had been sold. An elderly lady was in front of the door, with some beautiful flowers beside her. I walked to her. She looked to be in her early eighties and had the prettiest white hair.\n\"Hi! My name is Karmen,\" I said smiling brightly at the old lady. She smiled back and said, \"Hello, Karmen. I'm Henrietta.\" Her voice was very strong for someone at her age. Later, I learned she was alone and had no family or relatives to help her. From that day on, I often visited her and helped her with her housework and sometimes she gave me some delicious food. A year passed, and I considered Henrietta to be one of my best friends.\nOne day, I walked over for my morning visit and knocked on the door, but there was no answer. I knocked again, and she still didn' t _ . So I let myself in, using the key she had given me. I checked her living room and then her kitchen. I finally went into her bedroom, and she was lying peacefully on her bed. Beside her there were two notes. One was her will, which said all that she had would be given to me. The other was a thank-you note. I went to her bedside and cried sadly.\nThough several years have gone by, I still miss her deeply. Whenever I look at the beautiful flowers in front of her house, I remember the wonderful friendship we had.",

        "Thoughts on Shenzhen Airport Traffic Accident\nMarch 1 was a very sad day for everyone.\nOn that day a huge traffic accident happened at the Shenzhen Airport. Nine people lost their lives and 23 people were injured. For those people, it was a night- mare!\nTo learn a lesson, we must know who caused the accident and why.\nThe answer looks obvious. It's the car owner's fault because she drove her car into the people. However, is that true? Is that her fault? What about the dead and injured people? Did they have their own faults as well? The answer is yes.\nAccording to news reports, at that time, many people were standing in the turning section of the viaduct watching the airplanes take off and land. Suddenly, a car appeared. Maybe the car owner got nervous, so she mistakenly stamped on the accelerator instead of the brake pedal, which caused the accident.\nIn my opinion, of course the driver should be blamed because she caused the accident. However, for those dead and injured people, although we feel sorry for them, they have their own responsibilities as well. They should have been aware of their own safety. They shouldn't have been standing in a dangerous place to watch the airplanes take off and land.",

Then he held out his hand and grabbed my finger. \"Their tiny baby grew stronger and stronger in his mother's arms, and their final goodbye turned into a hello.\nThe doctor at first ignored the baby's movements, but when he put the stethoscope to his chest, his mouth was wide open and he said ,\"It's my fault, It's a miracle( ).\n\"The kangaroo care helps the baby keep body warmth\" Dr Pinchi Srinivasan said, \"It also regulates  heartbeat and breathing rates and is believed to help weight gain and improve  sleeping habits. Fathers can also use kangaroo care. The key to the method is skin-to-skin contact.\"\nThe practice began in less developed nations. It has become a recognized pracitce in helping premature babies. The techniques is good for babies, and is used in many baby care centers.",

        "Juno was a very playful dog but she was also very disobedient.     One afternoon Juno was out in the front yard playing tag with Sasha the kitten, when Billy came to fetch her for her bath.  Juno did not like baths very much and she ran away every time Billy got close to her.  Billy soon got tired of Juno's game, so he left her in the garden hoping she would keep running around and tire herself out.   Sasha the kitten followed Billy and Juno was surprised to find herself alone, she had hoped Billy would keep on playing this fun game.   To pass the time she watched some birds building a nest in a tree, Juno was so bored she even tried to play hide and seek with George, the parrot.  Finally, since there was nobody to play with Juno laid down to take a nap.\\newlineA little later Billy came back out into the yard to fetch Juno.   What Billy didn't know was, Juno had been sleeping since he left and she was ready for another game of catch me if you can, her favorite game.  Juno took off running as soon as she saw Billy.   Billy sat down on the grass to wait.  Billy found a ball and started to throw it for Juno to fetch.  Billy kept on throwing the ball and Juno kept on bringing it back until  Juno dropped the ball and lay down on the grass, panting, tired out.      Billy quickly slipped the collar and leash on her.   Billy got Juno on her feet and the two of them walked round to the back yard where the family were sitting outside enjoying the sunshine.   Billy's father called him to come and enjoy some ice cream with them but Billy said no, he'd rather get Juno's bath time over with and then he could enjoy his ice cream.   Billy knew he had to hurry or his brothers Allen and Greg would finish the Rocky Road ice cream which was Billy's favorite.\\newlineBilly tied Juno's leash to the fence and then he brought the hose over and switched it on.  Juno   immediately tried to run away but she had no choice but to stay there and let Billy soak her.   Billy quickly added soap to Juno's coat and soon she was covered in soapy suds.   Soon Billy once again turned the hose on Juno to rinse all the soap out of her coat.   The last thing to be done was to rub Juno down with a towel and dry her off\\newlineOnce Billy had finished he took the collar and leash off and Juno lay down in the sun happy that bath time was over once again.   Billy went to join the rest of the family and his father said he could choose between Chocolate Chip, Caramel Delight, Cookies and Cream or Rocky Road ice cream. Billy quickly said he wanted the Rocky Road and his father put down a large dish of the ice cream and said 'good job son'",

She had a lot of clothes to look through, but she needed something perfect for the dance, since she would be seen by a lot of other people, and she wanted to stand out from the rest of the girls. There would be a lot of boys there, too. If she looked as nice as she imagined she could, she would have a lot of boys asking her to dance. And she didn't want to dance alone, because that would make her feel sad.  But she had to hurry, since it was getting late, and she had to sleep soon. She was so excited, that she barely touched her baked potato she had during suppertime. She also had chicken, some green beans, and corn on the cob.\\newline\\newlineShe came down to four choices for what she could wear to the dance. a pink dress, a green dress, a red dress, and a yellow dress.

After making her choice, she changed into her pajamas and got in bed. She turned the light out and fell asleep. She dreamed about the fun she would have at the dance. Sally smiled as she slept.",

        "A letter of reply is sometimes a most treasured thing. Here is a story that tells about this common and natural human feeling.\nThe busiest woman in Labrador during one bitter cold Christmas not very long ago, was an Australian nurse named Kate Austen. But Nurse Austen was not too busy to write with a long, friendly letter for every gift of food or clothing received for poor villagers in the north of Australian. Among the gifts was a box of knittings   for children, knitted and sent by a woman in Toronto.\nNurse Austen, was busy, and not feeling too well that winter. She could have written just ordinary routine notes of acknowledgement. But that was not her way. She sat down and wrote the woman in Toronto a real letter telling all about the village, and the names of the children who were wearing the knitted gloves and caps, and what they said when they got them, and how they looked when they wore them. She wanted the woman who had knitted and sent all those lovely knittings \"to see how much happiness and warmth she had created.\" Not long after, she received the following answer from Canada.\nDear Miss Austen,\nYour letter made me happy. I did not expect such a full return, I am eighty years old, and I am blind. There is little I can do expect knit, and that is why I knit so many caps and sweaters scarves. For sixty years I have been making up missionary packages of such clothing or food or medicine or book as I could collect. But never before in all that time have I had a personal letter picturing the village and telling me who is wearing the clothing and what they said. I did not suppose that ever in my lifetime I should receive a letter like that. My God bless you.\nSincerely yours,                                                                  Laura N.

But she thought it was extra unfair today because she wanted to play with a new toy. The new toy was called Wiggle Giggle and Jill's friends said it was very fun. When Jill ran into her room, she jumped up on her bed. Frowning, she tried to think of a way to get her homework done very quickly. While she was thinking, she unwrapped a brownie and began to eat it. Brownies were her favorite snack and it made her feel a little better. Suddenly, Jill came up with a plan. She jumped down from the bed and stuffed the rest of the snack in her mouth. As she chewed, she opened her toy chest. Jill had to dig way down to the bottom, but she soon found what she was looking for: parts from a few broken toys. Things were looking up! Jill's plan was to build a robot to do her homework. Nothing would get in the way of her plan. It took her hours to finish it, but she was proud of her work. When it was done, she named the robot Mister Sparks. She told it, \"Mister Sparks, do my homework!\" Then Jill had to go eat dinner. After dinner, Jill spent the rest of the night playing Wiggle Giggle. It was so much fun! But Jill got some bad news before going to bed. Mister Sparks had not done any of the homework!",

The heroine of it is Ying Miaofang, an old woman from a village of Zhuji City in Shaoxing of Zhejiang Province. \"I rented a house in Shanghai and received more than 330 Expo visitors during three months' time. My house was never empty during that period.\" Ying told reporters.

Ying Miaofang paid 1,800yuan per month to rent a small house near Changning Road in Shanghai, and spent more money on a new air conditioner, a refrigerator, a TV set and other things. She published her phone number in the newspaper and opened the house for Expo visitors for free on June 23.\nBesides providing a free living place., Ying got up very early every morning to buy food, cook breakfast, clean rooms and wash clothes for those guests. Many of her guests wanted to pay some money to her when they left, but she refused. In order to support the Shanghai Would Expo, Ying spent about 20 thousand yuan in all, which could not be regarded as a little money for a woman from a village.",

When Hepburn died in 1993, the world mourned the loss of a great beauty, a great actress and a great humanitarian.\nBorn in Belgium on 4th May 1929, Hepburn dreamed of becoming a\nsuccessful ballet dancer. She had also been a model before she entered the film industry. In 1951, while acting in Monte Carlo Baby, Hepburn met the famous French writer Colette, who was attracted by Hepburn's beauty and charm. She insisted that Hepburn was the perfect girl to play the lead role in Gigi, a play based on her novel. That event marked the beginning of Hepburn's successful career.\nShortly after, Hepburn was chosen to play the lead role of a young princess in the Hollywood film Roman Holiday. It was a big success and earned her an Oscar for Best Actress. She also won a Tony Award for the play Ondine.[:..]\nDuring her lifetime, Hepburn earned four more Oscar nominations. In 1989, she made her final appearance in her last film Always and played the role of an angel.\nThroughout her acting years, she acted in only one TV series, Gardens of the world with Audrey Hepburn. By showing us the beauty of nature, Hepburn wanted to remind us that we should protect the environment.\nHepburn is remembered not just as a great actress, but also as a great humanitarian. She was honoured with a number of awards because of her efforts in her charity work. In 1992, the President of the United States presented her with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\nIn 1991, Hepburn discovered that she had cancer.

        "Juno was a very playful dog but she was also very disobedient.     One afternoon Juno was out in the front yard playing tag with Sasha the kitten, when Billy came to fetch her for her bath.  Juno did not like baths very much and she ran away every time Billy got close to her.  Billy soon got tired of Juno's game, so he left her in the garden hoping she would keep running around and tire herself out.   Sasha the kitten followed Billy and Juno was surprised to find herself alone, she had hoped Billy would keep on playing this fun game.   To pass the time she watched some birds building a nest in a tree, Juno was so bored she even tried to play hide and seek with George, the parrot.  Finally, since there was nobody to play with Juno laid down to take a nap.\\newlineA little later Billy came back out into the yard to fetch Juno.   What Billy didn't know was, Juno had been sleeping since he left and she was ready for another game of catch me if you can, her favorite game.  Juno took off running as soon as she saw Billy.   Billy sat down on the grass to wait.  Billy found a ball and started to throw it for Juno to fetch.  Billy kept on throwing the ball and Juno kept on bringing it back until  Juno dropped the ball and lay down on the grass, panting, tired out.      Billy quickly slipped the collar and leash on her.   Billy got Juno on her feet and the two of them walked round to the back yard where the family were sitting outside enjoying the sunshine.   Billy's father called him to come and enjoy some ice cream with them but Billy said no, he'd rather get Juno's bath time over with and then he could enjoy his ice cream.   Billy knew he had to hurry or his brothers Allen and Greg would finish the Rocky Road ice cream which was Billy's favorite.\\newlineBilly tied Juno's leash to the fence and then he brought the hose over and switched it on.  Juno   immediately tried to run away but she had no choice but to stay there and let Billy soak her.   Billy quickly added soap to Juno's coat and soon she was covered in soapy suds.   Soon Billy once again turned the hose on Juno to rinse all the soap out of her coat.   The last thing to be done was to rub Juno down with a towel and dry her off\\newlineOnce Billy had finished he took the collar and leash off and Juno lay down in the sun happy that bath time was over once again.   Billy went to join the rest of the family and his father said he could choose between Chocolate Chip, Caramel Delight, Cookies and Cream or Rocky Road ice cream. Billy quickly said he wanted the Rocky Road and his father put down a large dish of the ice cream and said 'good job son'",

She wondered how her own mother had gotten her to eat the food when she was a silly little girl like her daughter, Elise. She grabbed the telephone to ask her mother how she had done it. She had to wait a second before the older woman picked up, but she was greeted with a happy voice. She learned from her mother that she had tricked her into believing her broccoli was a forest of trees. Emilia thought this was a good plan. After she hung up the phone she picked up her son's pacifier off the floor. She then washed it off. She did not want there to be any dirt from the floor on the pacifier. When he daughter Elise came down the stairs for dinner she told her daughter a story about how she was a giant and broccoli was a small forest of trees. After that Elise always ate her broccoli.",

She was only fourteen years old------the same age at which I was introduced to such a thing. What a difference!\nMy father died on April 11,1986, and we donated his eyes as he had wanted. Three days later, Wendy said, \"Mum, I'm so proud of you for what did for Grandpa.\"\nAt that moment, I realized that my father gave much more than his eyes.",

It did not take me very long so I hung out in my room for a little bit longer before heading downstairs to the basement to tell my mom I was ready for my surprise. She came upstairs to see how I did and immediately saw what I did. She was not happy about it.

We got our food and headed to the picnic table.

It was partly true. But the main reason for leaving was that I wanted to complete my plan.\nFirst I had to get the kids to sleep. That was never easy at any time and tonight it was even more difficult. The eldest one wanted to know why we left the party early. I told him 10:30 pm was not early. As usual, I read them a bed time story, but I had to stop myself reading too quickly or _ would learn my secret.\nSilence finally came, and feeling like a thief   in the night, I went out of the house and into the garage. Taking one end, I pulled the bag out from its hiding place and took it into the garden. I was worried that my neighbours might see me and call the police.\nIt was already eleven o'clock. By the light of the moon I started working, trying to make as little noise as possible. And that was not easy with a saw   and a hammer  .\nAfter much hard work, I finally completed my work. I looked down at my watch. It was exactly 4:00 am. Then I went inside to have a shower and get a few hours of sleep. It wouldn't be long now before the kids would rush into my room and wake me up to tell me about the new tree-house Father Christmas brought them this year.",

This meant his father would take them sledding. This was one of Thomas' favorite winter activities, even if he always got a few bumps and scrapes along the way.\\newlineThomas heard a knocking noise downstairs and knew it was Ben at the door. He got excited. This meant they would be sledding soon. He grabbed another mouthful of one of his mother's famous sugar cookies and made his way downstairs, tripping on his shoes. He opened the door to see Ben's mom giving him a friendly smile down the walk. Ben let himself in and his mother waved goodbye to them both. Thomas asked Ben if he wanted a cup of hot chocolate and then he went to find his dad for some sledding action. \\newlineBoth Ben and Thomas were very happy. They got their gloves on and made their way out to the garage to wait for Thomas' dad. Thomas dad would be driving them the long distance to the park.",

Just tell me how much it costs.\"\nA well-dressed man heard it and asked, \"What kind of a miracle does your brother need?\"\n\"I don't know,\" she answered with her eyes full of tears. \"He's really sick and mum says he needs an operation. But my daddy can't pay for it, so I have brought all my money.\"\n\"How much do you have?\" asked the man.\n\"$ 1.11, but I can try and get some more,\" she answered.\n\"Well, what luck,\" smiled the man. \"$ 1.11, the price of a miracle for little brothers.\" He took up the girl's hand and said, \"Take me to where you live. I want to see your brother and meet your parents. Let's see if I have the kind of miracle you need.\"\nThat well-dressed man was Dr Carlton Armstrong, a famous doctor.

This was the signal that told her third grade class to go outside and start playtime.\\newline\\newlineThe students in Mrs. Snooter's class always tried to get to the front of the line in order to make sure they were the first outside. As soon as the doors opened, the whole class would race to the seesaw at the back of the playground. However, it was not an easy race. There were many things between the door and the seesaw that needed to be passed, and Mrs. Snooter's third grade class enjoyed the excitement that they added to the race.\\newline\\newlineFirst, the students had to pass the kindergartener's sandbox. This may sound simple, but the kindergarteners would often trap students by digging large holes in the sandbox. If students jumped over the holes, they might have sand thrown in their eyes.\\newline\\newlineIf a student could pass the sandbox test, the next problem was the jungle gym. The fifth grade class came to recess before Mrs. Snooter's class and would hang out on top of the jungle gym. They thought they were cool because they were the oldest kids in the whole school, and would not let any other classes come near the jungle gym. It was difficult, but some students in Mrs. Snooter's class would make it past.\\newline\\newlineFinally, there was a long run to the seesaw. Only a few students would still be racing at this point, and they would run as fast as they could. Every day, there was one boy who would push himself a little harder than the other students.

With most, that means slowing down --- even stopping and rereading a page or paragraph to really understand what the author is trying to say.\nLast summer, Google CEO Eric Schmidt said he was concerned about what he sees as a decline in slow reading. Instant messages and 140-character tweets appear to be reducing out ability to concentrate on a single idea or theme of a book, he told Foreign Policy Magazine.\nIt's easy to forget the benefits of deep reading in an age when anything worth doing is done fast. Experts warn that without deep reading, it is impossible to be an educated person of the world, a knowledgeable voter or even an imaginative thinker.\n\"If you want to have a deep relationship with a text and understand a complex idea, then slow reading is a preferred style. It is good for pleasure, too. It is not a rushed experience and you can lose yourself in a text,\" said Canadian writer John Miedema, the author of the book Slow Reading.\nUS' Ohlone College English professor Cynthia Lee Katona says reading is a highly social activity that builds the mind and social connections. If you read, she says, you simply know more and have more to talk about with friends, partners and people you know.\nDeep reading can also take a reader on a trip around the world even if they are sitting in a living room armchair, Katona says. Also, deep reading helps people develop thinking, writing and conversation skills.\n\"If you like beautiful things, authors put words together that are really beautiful and expressive,\" she says. \"If you want to write well--- and there are lots of reasons to express yourself clearly --- you should read.\"",

        "Billy went to the farm to buy some beef for his brother's birthday. When he arrived there he saw that all six of the cows were sad and had brown spots. The cows were all eating their breakfast in a big grassy meadow. He thought that the spots looked very strange so he went closer to the cows to get a better look.  When he got closer he also saw that there were five white chickens sitting on the fence. The fence was painted blue and had some dirty black spots on it.  Billy wondered where the dirty spots had come. Soon he got close to the chickens and they got scared. All five chickens flew away and went to eat some food. After Billy got a good look at the cows he went to the farmer to buy some beef. The farmer gave him four pounds of beef for ten dollars. Billy thought that it was a good deal so he went home and cooked his brother dinner. His brother was very happy with the dinner.  Billy's mom was also very happy.",

That' s why I haven' t written for such a long time.\nSince the beginning of this year we' ve been doing a project called ' World Class'. Have you heard of it.'? Not everyone in the class could take part, but luckily I could. The school chooses a 'twin school'   in a different area of the world. Our head teacher chose a school in Uganda. They gave us someone to write to from that school. For three months, I've written to a girl called Louisa, who is the same age as me.\nIt' s been more interesting to hear about her life. She' s told me all about her school and described her daily   life. I can' t believe that her School doesn' t. have any electricity. She goes to 'school from eight o' clock in the morning until six. O'clock. in the evening. I can' t believe how lucky we are here! She' s also told me that she often can' t go to school because she has to look after her baby brother and sister. She's tried to teach me some of her language and it' s really difficult.\nI love it because it' s the first time I' ve thought about what life must be like somewhere else. I can' t believe people miss classes here when everything is so easy for us. I think more people should help out with projects like this. At the weekend we' re going to have a sports day to help raise money to send to the school. Perhaps one day I'll be able to go to Uganda and meet Louisa myself--who knows?\nLots of 1ove,\nSuzanne",

As he watched the mother and daughter leave the store, he ran to the candy counter and bought a box of Smarties with the money .\nHe turned to look at me and I just nodded. He ran out after the little girl and her mother and he gave them the box. He came back and told me what he told them. \"Every kid should have a pack of Smarties because they can make you smart.\"\nI was so excited that I bought a pack of Smarties for my son. I told him that I was proud of him, and that was for his act of generosity because he gave his own Smarties to others. Quickly, he replied, \"But you do nice things for people and you never get anything for it.\"I explained, \"When you do something nice for someone, you shouldn't expect to get anything. When you get something you should be very thankful.\"",

He took the young man through many streets of the big city.\nAfter a long time, they arrived at the hotel. \"Here we are! You should pay me fifteen dollars, please.\"the taxi driver said to the young man. \"What? Fifteen dollars! Do you think I'm a fool?

I am here for you and you are loved in this family.\"\nThere was no answer for a while, but then I heard a tearing sound coming from inside the bathroom. Kevin, who had run out of words wrote on a torn paper cup. \"Thanks.\"\nI wrote back, \"For what?\" It returned to me with \"Loving me.\" On it.\nSince then, I try my best to never only half-notice my family members any more.

He asked his Grandpa what kind of animal poop he had found. He wanted to know if it was a lion, a tiger or a bear that had made the poop. Grandpa pointed in the bushes. Andrew saw a small black and white animal looking at him with big eyes. Andrew knew that he had was looking at a raccoon. He was sure that the raccoon had made the poop. When Andrew and Grandpa got to the river they put their fishing poles into the water. Andrew caught his first fish right away. He caught a second fish before lunch. He got hungry and had his Peanut Butter and Jelly sandwich and cool water. He saw that Grandpa had fallen asleep. After eating his lunch, Andrew caught three more fish before he woke up his grandpa. When Andrew and Grandpa got back home they gave all the fish they had caught to Andrew's mother, so she could make a good dinner.",

        "Once upon a time, there was an old man named John. John loved to eat peaches. In fact, John's whole family, including his mother Stephanie, his father Bob, and his brother James loved to eat peaches. John would eat peaches in the morning for breakfast, in the afternoon for lunch, and in the evening for dinner. John and his best friend, Rick, shared their love for peaches. One day John and Rick started a peach farm so that they would never run out of their favorite fruit. They planted hundreds of peach trees and waited for them to bear fruit. After 6 years of waiting, 1 lonely peach finally grew on one of the trees John and Rick planted. They picked the peach and brought it home. They waited until the weekend to eat it in case more peaches grew, but none did. John and Rick were sad and confused about their farm. They planted hundreds of trees and were sure that there would be thousands of peaches for them to eat in no time. Another peach never grew on their farm for 17 years. One day, a mighty crack of thunder led to a strong storm. Lightning hit the ground over and over, and John and Rick were scared their trees might be killed. The next morning, every tree on the farm had more than 10 peaches on it. John and Rick started shouting for joy.",

        "While walking in the park on Monday with my granddaughter Tina, we saw an ice cream truck pull up on the street. \"Can we get ice cream, Nana?\" asked Tina. \"Sure we can!\" I answered. As we started heading up the hill to the truck, my granddaughter was scared by a bird who had swooped by her face. \"Nana, that bird almost made me fall down the hill!\" Laughing at what was said, I answered, \"If you fell you might have taken Nana down with you!\" Once we reached the ice cream truck, Tina saw that they not only had ice cream but also carried popcorn, hotdogs, juice and soda. \"Nana, instead of ice cream may I get popcorn and juice?\" she asked. \"If that is what you want, you sure can!\" I answered. We got our food and headed to the picnic table. On our way over we saw a child who Tina knew from her kindergarten class. \"Nana, may we go and say hello to Mary?\" \"Let's go!\" We made it over to where Mary and her family were sitting and Tina saw a bright blue butterfly. She did everything she could to try and catch that pretty butterfly but it kept flying way to high for her to catch. \"That is okay\", she said, \"Butterflies need to be left out to fly free\".  Mary asked Tina if she wanted to go over her house and play Barbies when we left the park, instead of going home. So we went over and the girls had a wonderful time and were both tired after a long day. We needed to get a good night's sleep to enjoy our camping trip tomorrow.",

When we got back, I put the shoes on the table and opened the umbrella to check if it was all right. Your grandmother came in and screamed!\n'Then I broke a small mirror in the bathroom.

You must not kill a \"money spider\", or the same will happen. Also it is very unlucky to walk under a ladder or put new shoes on the table. An open umbrella in a house means someone will die.

        "Last Saturday was the best day of Timmy's summer. After waking up at nine and turning on his lamp, Timmy ran downstairs, counting the steps as he always did. There were always seven. At the bottom, he jumped over his dog Lucky who was licking himself clean. Timmy took a bite of toast and a sip of the orange juice his mom Suzie had left on the table for him before running outside to check the mail. Before he made it down the steps, he almost tripped on a big package waiting for him. It was here! Timmy's birthday present from his grandmother Betty had arrived. He brought it into the kitchen, where his dad Ryan was waiting for him with a grin on his face. As Timmy tore into the package, he found the greatest present he could have asked for. It was a huge water gun! Timmy immediately filled it up and ran outside to begin playing. His neighbor Maeby came outside with her water hose after eating her sandwich and the two got in a water fight! Soon, Timmy's dad came outside to play too! He brought 11 water balloons. Soon all five of Timmy's friends were playing in the water with each other. Timmy's water gun was the best toy out there. It worked by winding up the handle before firing the water. Soon it was evening and Timmy's dad was firing up the grill to cook hotdogs and hamburgers for Timmy's friends and their families.",

But she thought it was extra unfair today because she wanted to play with a new toy. The new toy was called Wiggle Giggle and Jill's friends said it was very fun. When Jill ran into her room, she jumped up on her bed. Frowning, she tried to think of a way to get her homework done very quickly. While she was thinking, she unwrapped a brownie and began to eat it. Brownies were her favorite snack and it made her feel a little better. Suddenly, Jill came up with a plan. She jumped down from the bed and stuffed the rest of the snack in her mouth. As she chewed, she opened her toy chest. Jill had to dig way down to the bottom, but she soon found what she was looking for: parts from a few broken toys. Things were looking up! Jill's plan was to build a robot to do her homework. Nothing would get in the way of her plan. It took her hours to finish it, but she was proud of her work. When it was done, she named the robot Mister Sparks. She told it, \"Mister Sparks, do my homework!\" Then Jill had to go eat dinner. After dinner, Jill spent the rest of the night playing Wiggle Giggle. It was so much fun!

She wondered how her own mother had gotten her to eat the food when she was a silly little girl like her daughter, Elise. She grabbed the telephone to ask her mother how she had done it. She had to wait a second before the older woman picked up, but she was greeted with a happy voice. She learned from her mother that she had tricked her into believing her broccoli was a forest of trees. Emilia thought this was a good plan. After she hung up the phone she picked up her son's pacifier off the floor. She then washed it off. She did not want there to be any dirt from the floor on the pacifier. When he daughter Elise came down the stairs for dinner she told her daughter a story about how she was a giant and broccoli was a small forest of trees. After that Elise always ate her broccoli.",

        "To: manager@tastytreat.com\nDate: Monday, 7th October, 3:34 p.m.\nFrom: raymondyuen@canada.net\nSubject: Complaint\nDear Mr. Price,\nI have eaten in your restaurant many times and have always been happy with the food and service. This makes what happened last Saturday even more disappointing .\nIt was my son's birthday so we booked a non-smoking table at your restaurant for 7:30 p.m. We arrived on time but were told that our table was not yet ready. At 8:00 p.m., we were given a table in the smoking area. I asked to move but I was told that there were no other tables. A lot of people were smoking so it was uncomfortable and unhealthy.\nOur first waitress, Janet, was very polite and helpful. She gave us free drinks for waiting so long. Our food also came quickly and looked fresh and tasty. When my wife had eaten most of her meal, she found a dead cockroach in her vegetables. She was shocked and wanted to leave. At first, the waitress told us it was a piece of garlic .When we told her it had legs, she apologized\n(=\"said\" sorry) and took the food away.\nWe asked for the pay for my wife's meal bill, expecting not to pay for my wife's meal. Nobody came. After 15 minutes, I asked to see the manager. The headwaiter told us that you were on holiday. I complained again about the horrible cockroach. He told me Janet had finished work. He didn't believe my story and gave me a bill for three meals. I argued with him but was forced to pay.\nThe waitress, Janet, was always friendly, but I would like an apology from your impolite headwaiter and a full refund for our meal. It cost $68. Until then, I will not be eating at your restaurant or recommending it to anyone.\nYou can contact me at 742-3254 or through e-mail if you want more information.\nThank you for your attention.\nYours sincerely,\nRaymond Yuen",

        "Early to bed, early to rise , makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise.\nThis is an old English saying. Have you heard it before? It means that we must go to bed early in the evening and get up early in the morning. If we do, we shall be healthy. We shall also be rich (wealthy) and clever (wise).\nIs this true? Perhaps it is. The body must have enough sleep. Children need ten hours' sleep every night. If you do not go to bed early, you cannot have enough sleep. Then you cannot think properly and you cannot do your work properly. You will not be wise and you may not become wealthy!\nSome people go to bed late at night and get up late in the morning. This is not good for them. We must sleep at night when it is dark. The dark helps us to sleep properly, When the daylight comes, we must get up. This is the time for exercise. Exercise means doing things with the body. Walking, running, jumping, swimming, and playing games are all exercise. If the body is not used, it becomes weak. Exercise keeps it strong. Exercise helps the blood  to move around inside the body. This is very important. The brains in our heads also need blood. We think with our brains. If we keep our bodies healthy, and take exercise, we can think better.\nOur bodies also need air to breathe. Without air we die. We must have a lot of clean, fresh air to breathe if we want to be healthy.",

The game is \"Room Escape\". \"Room Escape\" was originally a computer game. In recent years, it has been adapted to a real life game. There are more than 10 places in Beijing where people can play this game.\nAccording to the rules, the players are first taken to a house with several iron doors. They then need to find a way out of the house in one hour. Different houses have different ways of escaping, all of which require players' bold , careful thought, and teamwork.\nNews two: The Chinese government has published a list of 24 guidelines  on how to take better care of parents. They are a modern update to 24 old stories about respectful children from the Yuan Dynasty.\nThe guidelines list 24 things to do with parents, including giving them a call every week, teaching them to use the internet, and supporting single parents' remarriage. The guidelines stem from a Yuan Dynasty book, about 24 filial-hearted children who treated their parents very well. It is a value younger generations should never forget.",

        "French doctors and American scientists have reported doing an operation in which the doctor was outside the operating room. This kind of operation is known as robotic operation.\nDoctor Marescaux did the operation in an office in New York City last month, while a sixty-eight-year-old woman patient was in a hospital in Strasbourg, France.\nA doctor in Strasbourg got the patient ready. He placed medical tools and a small video camera in her stomach area. Doctor Marescaux in New York watched the patient on a video screen. Then he used the computer to send messages to the robot machine. The robot moved the tools that cut the woman's gallbladder away. The woman got well soon after the operation and left the hospital two days later.\nExperts say the main problem with such a robotic operation is based on high-speed telecommunications between the doctor and the robot. Technology must be able to send a doctor's order to a robot to move the tools quickly.\nExperts also say a successful robotic operation will improve an operation. For example, the robot can make much smaller movements than a person can. A robot machine can turn tools in ways that a doctor's hand cannot.\nDoctors say such a robotic operation will make possible safer and better operations in the future. They say it will improve doctor training. It will also mean that doctors could do an operation on people in dangerous places far away. And it could mean that people could have operations done by top doctors without having to travel to the city where doctors work.",

When he got closer he also saw that there were five white chickens sitting on the fence. The fence was painted blue and had some dirty black spots on it.  Billy wondered where the dirty spots had come. Soon he got close to the chickens and they got scared. All five chickens flew away and went to eat some food.

        "For nearly 250 years, Debrett's has advised the British public on suitable social manners. Now, it has listed modern guide to good manners, answering the questions that most trouble the British public in 2014.\nUsing mobile phone in public\nMore questions are asked about mobile use than any other case. According to Debrett's, it is always rude to pay more attention to a phone than the people around you, and they should always be put away when you're paying for something in a shop. They should be turned off in theatres, cinemas or any space where silence is required.\nSmoking e-cigarettes at work\nAs electronic cigarettes become more popular, questions about whether they are acceptable in the workplace are asked more often. According to Debrett's, they should never be used in a work environment. Smoking e-cigarettes at work shows that you're not focused on your work and may also have a bad influence on your workmates.\nGiving up your seat on public transport\nIn a recent university experiment only 20 per cent of London tube passengers are willing to give up their seat to people in need. According to Debrett's, passengers should always offer to give up their seat to any person that is pregnant, elderly, or clearly in need. It is important to remember, however, that it is just as impolite to rudely refuse the offer of a seat as it is to not offer a seat.\nEating before everyone is served\nThe final question is one that we've all asked ourselves: is it rude to start eating at the table before everyone else has been served? According to Debrett's, the simple answer is yes, unless the host or hostess _ dinners to start.",

In fact, John's whole family, including his mother Stephanie, his father Bob, and his brother James loved to eat peaches. John would eat peaches in the morning for breakfast, in the afternoon for lunch, and in the evening for dinner. John and his best friend, Rick, shared their love for peaches. One day John and Rick started a peach farm so that they would never run out of their favorite fruit. They planted hundreds of peach trees and waited for them to bear fruit. After 6 years of waiting, 1 lonely peach finally grew on one of the trees John and Rick planted. They picked the peach and brought it home. They waited until the weekend to eat it in case more peaches grew, but none did. John and Rick were sad and confused about their farm. They planted hundreds of trees and were sure that there would be thousands of peaches for them to eat in no time. Another peach never grew on their farm for 17 years. One day, a mighty crack of thunder led to a strong storm. Lightning hit the ground over and over, and John and Rick were scared their trees might be killed. The next morning, every tree on the farm had more than 10 peaches on it. John and Rick started shouting for joy.",

        "His parents were out and dropped him at the babysitter's house at 12 o'clock. Lunchtime had past, but later the babysitter fixed him a dinner of some kind of brown meat. Under the meat was a slice of dry toast. Timmy didn't like the dinner and wished he had spaghetti or pizza. Even if it wasn't what he wanted, the meal filled his tummy and stopped the hunger pains.\\newline  \\newlineTimmy was bored and wanted something to do, but he didn't have any toys. All he had was some paper, his toothbrush and toothpaste. He wished he was home where he had left his favorite toy race car and train. The house was quiet and nighttime was near. He pretended he was camping. It was 8 o'clock and the streetlight came on and shined through the curtain, making scary shadows on the wall.  \\newline\\newlineHe looked through the trash in the babysitter's extra room but couldn't find anything useful. If he at least had some markers or crayons he could draw some pictures, but he didn't even have a pencil. \\newline\\newlineTimmy thought for a bit and found he could make a toy boat. He folded the paper into a mighty ship.   In his imagination the little boat was in a storm on a dark sea. Danger was all around. The imaginary men on his paper boat were facing the storm bravely and sailed into safety as he was falling asleep.",

One day, Charlie showed up at the zoo that he worked at and saw that a turtle had escaped!  He quickly picked up the radio and told all of the other workers to look out for the missing Turtle named Brian.  Because of this, the zoo had to close down for the whole day!  They were trying so hard, but still could not find any clue to where the turtle went.  Finally, a girl named Samantha went on the radio and said that she found Brian eating lettuce in the Polar Bear cage.  She also told everyone that the Polar Bears were protecting Brian!  For hours, the zoo team tried to find a way to get Brian out of the cage without getting hurt themselves.  Charlie finally had an idea.  He was going to take a stuffed turtle from the gift shop, sneak into the cage, put the Polar Bears to sleep for a little bit, and then place the stuffed turtle where Brian was eating his lettuce.  Charlie's plan worked, but the Polar Bears woke up and weren't happy!  They took the stuffed turtle and ripped it up!  Samantha went to find some fish to make them happy again as Charlie told Brian the turtle to never run off again.",

I was born sixty-eight years ago in a small village.\nTransportation used to be a big problem. When we travelled from village to village, we used to walk or ride horses.\nShopping was not an easy job, either. There were no supermarkets in the neighborhood. We used to grow most of our own food: rice and vegetables. We kept things cool in a special underground room.\nThe biggest difference is that you have electricity. We didn't have electricity until very late in our small village. We didn't have any televisions of course. We used to perform our local music and enjoy it very much.\nLife used to be very hard, but I was not upset. I would like you to know about the old days and be happy about what you have. Remember , feeling good about life is the key to happiness.\nLove\nYour grandma",

She felt like she did a really good job, but she was scared, too. Jill had to wait until tomorrow to see how she did. The next day she hurried back to class. Jill walked in and grabbed her test from the stack of papers. She let out a yell. Jill had failed. She turned to her friend Michelle and started to cry. She was so upset.",

        "Jon woke up knowing that today was finally the day.  It was his birthday!  He had been waiting for this day all year long.  He was super excited to get all his presents and hoped he finally got the basketball he wanted.  As he ran outside, he saw his parents weren't even awake yet!  He looked at the clock and it was still only six in the morning.  He tried to wake up his parents, but they told him to go back to sleep.  Jon went back to his bed and laid there until it was finally time to open presents.  His parents were brushing their teeth and taking a shower, so Jon waited outside where the presents were.  He saw that he had three gifts from his parents waiting for him.  He had really hoped there was a basketball.  The first gift he opened was a new pair of pants his mom had bought for him.  The second gift he opened was a picture of his favorite basketball player to hang on his wall.  Jon was starting to feel nervous as there was only one gift left!  He wished and wished with all his might for a basketball.  The last box was a square shape.  If it was a basketball, surely it would have been round!  He opened the box and saw that it really was a basketball!  His parents had put it in a box so it wouldn't be clear.  He was so happy he hugged his parents and told them thank you.  His parents brought the cake out and he ate cake, holding on to his basketball the whole time. There was pizza and ice cream and chips, but Jon was too full and wanted to play with his new ball right away!",

        "Tyler was a troublesome student. He sat in the back row. Every time I called him to answer questions, he'd reply with a flip answer. If he got it wrong, he would get very angry.\nUsually kids could sit quietly in class. However, Tyler was just loud. One day, Tyler was talking while I was teaching. I said to him, \"Tyler, why not join in our discussion instead of having one of your own?\" He got up from his chair, pushed it over, and shouted something I can't remember. I sent him to the office and he received a week's out-of-school punishment.\nThe week was a wonderful time for me, but when it came to an end, I began to feel worried. So I came up with a plan. On the day of his return, I told him I wanted to start over with him. If he felt like he was going to lose control in class, he could step outside the door for a moment.\nFrom then on, Tyler was a changed student in my classroom. In fact he was a smart child and he even stopped a fight between two students one day. And he never used the privilege to leave the class for a moment. I believe that just letting him decide for himself made all the difference.\nWhen the year was over, he wrote me a thank-you note about how good the year had been for him. I still have it today and find it very moving to reread when I get stressed about teaching.",

        "Tea bag drinking is most Westerners' favorite way of drinking tea. Do you know how it came about?\nThe tea bag was invented in 1908 by Thomas Sullivan, an American tea seller. He was sending out free tea in silk bags for people to try. People put the bags together with the tea leaves into the cup and added  hot water. The tea tasted good, and people thought it was easy to clean the cup. They were not happy when Sullivan started sending them loose   tea again.\nSullivan realized that he had a hot new thing in his hands, and he built a machine to pack the bags. As tea bags became popular, they were changed from silk to gauze   and later paper. In 1952, Lipton Tea made the tea bag even more popular with its invention of the four-sided tea bag. Tea bags were soon a hit in the UK, and today 85%of the tea in the UK is packed in paper bags.\nHowever, many people still prefer loose-leaf tea.  This is because some tea companies put not very good tea in their tea bags. But for most drinkers, tea bags are still the easy and tasly way to go.",

Now she always leaves her phone in another room at night. And she encourages friends to do so. \"I sent each of my friends the same christmas gift - an alarm clock so that they could stop using their phones as the alarm clock,\" she said.\nIf your mobile phone wakes you up in the morning, it may also be keeping you up at night. A study in 2008 showed that people in mobile phone radiation mostly had sleeping problems. And according to a Swedish study, a quarter of young people in this country feel like there must be phones around them. Most of them feel sorry for not returning messages. So they even have to reply to their friends before sleeping.\nSo what kind of people prefer to use mobile phones in their bedrooms? A recent study has shown that three-quarter people aged between 18 and 34 prefer to sleep with their phones near them. That number falls off a little in middle age, but only people aged 65 and older are used to leaving the phone in another room while sleeping.",

If you can't, don't feel too bad: neither could the middle school teacher in England who received this as homework. This is Net speak: the language of computerized communication found on Internet or cell phones. To newcomers, it can look like a completely foreign language. So, what is the \"translation\" of the sentence above? My summer holidays were a complete waste of time. Before, we used to go to New York to see my brother, his girlfriend, and their three screaming kids face to face. I love New York; it's great.\nSchoolteachers and parents say this new form of writing is harming the English language. Increasing spelling and grammatical mistakes can be seen in students' writing. They fear the language could become corrupted .\nEveryone should just relax, say linguists . They believe Net speak is in fact more of a good thing. David Crystal, from the University of Wales, argues that Net speak and Internet create a new language use and the almost lost art of diary writing has been picked up again. Geoffrey Nurnberg, from Stanford University, agrees. \"People get better at writing by writing,\" he says, \"Kids who are now doing text messages, e-mail, and instant messages will write at least as well as, and possibly better than, their parents.\"\nLinguist James Milroy says, for centuries, it is believed without exception that young people are harming the language. And you can bet your bottom dollar that when today's teenagers become tomorrow's parents, they too will think this way. Milroy argues that languages do not and cannot become \"corrupted\"; they simply change to meet the new needs.\nHowever, Net speakers do agree that it is important to teach young people how to speak and write Standard  English. Cynthia McVey says, \"I can understand Net speak worries teachers and it's important that they get across to their pupils that text messaging is for fun, but that learning to write proper English is a must for their future.\"\nPerhaps we should give teenagers a little more trust anyway. Erin, age 12, says, \"I wouldn't use text language in my homework. Texting is just for fun\".",

A writer has said, \"People can't live without computers today.\"21cnjy.com\nThe Internet came a little later than computers. It is about twenty-five years later than computers.

They often go into the Internet bars as soon as they are free. They make friends on the Internet and maybe they have never seen these friends. They don't know their names, ages and sex . They are so interested in making the \"unreal friends\" that they can't put their heart into study. Some of them play the games in the Internet bars all day and all night. Many of them can't catch up with others in many subjects because of that.\nNow the government has done many things. Some gangster Internet bars have been banned . But that's not enough. The teachers and parents are still worrying about their students and children.\nWe can use computers and the Internet to learn more about the world.

These are all free to visit-which is great if you just want to see a few things,and not spend all day inside.The Air and Space Museum was particularly good:it had lots of aircrafts and rockets on display,interesting information and also some interactive parts.We also went to the National U. S. Holocaust )Memorial Museum. Naturally,it was sad to read about the horrors of this tragedy which affected so many people in World War II .However,it was also incredibly interesting to read the stories of those who survived the Holocaust,as well as those who helped others.\nLast but not least,I also found the 9/11 Memorial and Museum to be of great interest. This museum is dedicated to those who lost their lives,as well as their families,when the Twin Towers in New York City were attacked by terrorists in 2001 .It tells you how the terrorists planned the attack,how they hijacked the planes,and ultimately what happened as a result of their actions.Surviving pieces of the towers are shown in the museum,alongside damaged fire engines. It was a truly thought-provoking visit,which made me value my own life that little bit more.\nI think museums play an important role in preserving artifacts of historical importance for future generations.Whatever your interests,there is likely to be a museum for you. You can visit waxwork museums to see models of your favorite celebrities(and get photos with the Queen!),science museums for a more hands-on,interactive visit and so much more!Best of all,if you're ever in the UK,many of them are free!",

        "You may have known several kinds of police --- traffic police, fire police and street police. But have you ever heard of energy-saving  policeman?\nA group of 22 energy-saving policemen went to work last week in Beijing. They go around the city to see the use of energy in hotels, office buildings, shopping centers and other public places. One of their aims is to make sure that these places have set their air conditioning  no cooler than 26degC.\nThey also set up a special phone line so that people can tell them which buildings fail to follow the rule.\n\"If everyone sets their air conditioning at 26degC, Beijing will save 400 million kilowatthour of electricity in one summer. That's one-third of all the usages of the city in the season,\" said a TV advertisement.\nOther Chinese cities, like Wuhan in Hubei Province and Yangzhou in Jiansu Province, are going to follow Beijing's steps in setting up a similar police team.\nAs one of the fastest developing countries, China is using a lot of energy. This has a great effect on the country's environment and limited  energy.\nFrom 1986 to 2005, the country experienced 20 warm winters continuously . Numbers show that Chinese cities have to spend billions of yuan solving environmental problems every year.\nAt the beginning of this month, China made its first action plan to fight pollution. It aims to reduce energy usage by 20% and increase renewable  energy up to 10% from 7% by 2010.\nTo introduce the public to a green life, last week Beijing held a show on energy-saving technology and productions. Environment-friendly machines, such as a vending machine that helps collect used bottles, have attracted lots of attention. \"We want to tell people that there are certain ways to protect the environment. Each of us can find effective ways to do it on our daily lives,\" said Liu Qianguang, an environmental engineer in Beijing.",

Adam said that all he had to do was ignore the bully and he would feel better. Then Adam asked why his mom could not ignore her new boss. Deborah explained to Adam that her new boss could fire her. Deborah frowned, took off her pink shoes, and walked inside the house to make rice for dinner.",

        "Do you want to know about my staying in America? It was really an eye-opening experience. In China, I had English classes five times a week. However, I didn't know how different textbook English was from daily English until I went to Hotchkiss School, Connecticut. When I first studied English, I was told to say \"I'm fine\" when people say \"How are you?\" But in America, I found that people said \"I'm good\" or \"I'm tired.\" One day, someone greeted me with \"What's up?\" It made me _ . I thought for a moment and then smiled because I didn't know what to say.\nTo my surprise, American girls spend a lot of time in the burning sun. However, in China, girls try every possible way to get their skin whiter. I'm also surprised by how hard-working American students are. In China, schoolwork is almost everything, so we study hard. But in America, a good student gets good grades, does a lot for the public and plays sports or music.",

Timmy called Buster over to come talk to the hamster and see if there was anything they could do to help. As they talked, Timmy and Buster started to become good friends with the hamster. They found out his name was Henry. Henry was on his way to the river for a drink of water when a mean horse ran by and without looking at where he was going stepped on his leg and broke it. Luckily for Henry Busters mom was a nurse and after watching her work for many years Buster knew how to set a broken bone and fix it. After Buster fixed Henry's leg he picked him up and put him on Timmy's back and they all went to the river to get some water.

This is the one day of the year when people around the world care about their sleep and ask themselves a lot of questions about sleep.\nWhy do we need sleep? Nobody as yet can give a correct answer to this question. However, tests have shown that lack of sleep over about four weeks leads to a strong drop in body temperature, great weight loss and finally sickness.\nDifferent people need different amounts of sleep. Eight hours a night is considered the average amount of sleep. For teenagers the least number of sleeping hours advised by doctors are ten hours for primary school students, nine for junior highs and eight for senior highs.\nSome people seem to get along just fine with very little sleep at night. Leading American scientist Thomas Edison said that sleep was a waste of time. He did, however, take naps during the day. On the other hand, Albert Einstein, another great scientist, said he needed at least ten hours' sleep a night.\nHere are some of the most useful suggestions, for a good night's sleep.\nGo to bed regularly. Use your bed only to sleep. Don't exercise in the evening. Keep the bedroom dark and quiet. Drink a glass of milk before sleep.",

The middle school teacher in England who received this as homework couldn't either. This is Netspeak: the language of computerized communication found on Internet or mobile phones. To newcomers, it can look like a completely foreign language. So, what is the \"translation\" of the sentence above? My summer holidays were a complete waste of time. Before, we used to go to New York to see my brother, his girlfriend, and their three screaming kids face to face. I love New York; it's great.\nSchoolteachers and parents say this new form of writing is harming the English language. Increasing spelling and grammatical mistakes can be seen in students' writing. They fear the language could become corrupted  .\nEveryone should just relax, say linguists  . They believe Netspeak is in fact more of a good thing. David Crystal, from the University of Wales, argues that Netspeak and Internet create a new language use and the almost lost art of diary writing has been picked up again. Geoffrey Nunberg, from Stanford University, agrees. \"People get better at writing by writing,\" he says, \"Kids who are now doing text messaging and e-mail will write at least as well as, and possibly better than, their parents.\"\nLinguist James Milroy says, for centuries, it is believed without exception that young people are harming the language. And you can\nthat when today's teenagers become tomorrow's parents, they too will think this way. Milroy argues that languages do not and cannot become \"corrupted\", and that they simply change to meet the new needs.\nHowever, Netspeakers do agree that it is important to teach young people how to speak and write Standard English. Cynthia Mcvey says, \"I can understand Netspeak worries teachers and it's important that they get across to their pupils that text messaging is for fun, but that learning to write proper English is a must for their future.\"\nPerhaps we should give teenagers a little more trust anyway. Erin, age 12, says, \"I wouldn't use text language in my homework. Texting is just for fun.\"",

We like cool things.\"\nAnn doesn't know why her friend says that. When she goes home, she talks to her father.\n\"Dad, am I strange?\"\n\"I don't think so.

        "Jon woke up knowing that today was finally the day.  It was his birthday!  He had been waiting for this day all year long.  He was super excited to get all his presents and hoped he finally got the basketball he wanted.  As he ran outside, he saw his parents weren't even awake yet!  He looked at the clock and it was still only six in the morning.  He tried to wake up his parents, but they told him to go back to sleep.  Jon went back to his bed and laid there until it was finally time to open presents.  His parents were brushing their teeth and taking a shower, so Jon waited outside where the presents were.  He saw that he had three gifts from his parents waiting for him.  He had really hoped there was a basketball.  The first gift he opened was a new pair of pants his mom had bought for him.  The second gift he opened was a picture of his favorite basketball player to hang on his wall.  Jon was starting to feel nervous as there was only one gift left!  He wished and wished with all his might for a basketball.  The last box was a square shape.  If it was a basketball, surely it would have been round!  He opened the box and saw that it really was a basketball!  His parents had put it in a box so it wouldn't be clear.  He was so happy he hugged his parents and told them thank you.  His parents brought the cake out and he ate cake, holding on to his basketball the whole time. There was pizza and ice cream and chips, but Jon was too full and wanted to play with his new ball right away!",

        "June 6this National Eye Care Day. It is a good chance for us to improve our eye health. What are common eye problems we have today? How can we protect our eyes? Read on to find out the answer.\nEyes are important in our everyday life. We use them to read books, see colors and view the wonders of the world. But sometimes, we use them too much and it hurts them.\nIn the past, nearsightedness   was a common eye problem among children. This is mostly because of their bad eye habits, such as watching TV too long and reading books in bed.\nHowever, today's technology is changing the way we live. Children spend more time working and playing in front of computers, smartphones and iPads. US children spend more than 42 hours a week in front of electronic screens  , US' ABC news reported.\nThis has caused a new problem for our eyes: digital   eyestrain  . People with digital eyestrain may get headaches, dry and red eyes, eye pain, watering and other eye problems.\nBut don't worry. The following tips can help you protect your eyes. Try them out.\nScreen advice:\n1. When you are watching electronic screens, keep them at least 30 cm from your eyes. Try not to use     your smartphone in direct sunlight.\n2. Blink   more often when you are looking at the screen. This can help to stop dry eyes.\n3. Remember to take a 20-20-20 break: every 20 minutes, take a 20-second break and look at something                  20 feet (about 6 meters) away.\n4. Spend less time in front of screens. One to two hours a day is OK for your eyes.",

        "There once was a girl named Erin who had a really close friend named Kevin.  They really liked being with each other, only it was difficult as Erin lived in England and Kevin lived in the United States.  Because they both liked traveling and Erin wanted to see Kevin, she planned a trip to see him in the United States one summer.  They had planned to travel around where Kevin lived and then go to see New York City at one point in order to see the sights and have a really nice steak dinner together.  Once Erin arrived and met Kevin at the airport, she ran up to him and jumped into his arms, giving him a great big hug.  They drove home where Kevin helped Erin organize her things before they changed and watched a movie together.  The next day, they went out to have breakfast at the diner.  They thought about getting eggs, French toast, or cereal... but couldn't make up their minds.  Finally, Kevin asked the worker to bring out pancakes for the two of them to share.  They had a really fun time together, visiting the beach, watching movies, and even visiting New York City like they had planned.  In the morning, they went to see the Empire State building.  In the afternoon, they saw the Statue of Liberty and Central Park.  At night, they went to have their dinner and went back to their hotel.  As Erin's trip was ending, Erin became really sad about leaving Kevin.  They talked and came up with a plan for the months ahead which made Erin feel a lot better.

I had decided to try for a job in radio. One day, I wanted to host  a sports program. I went to Chicago and knocked on the door of every station. But I got turned down every time.\nIn one station, a kind lady said my problem was that I hadn't got enough experience. \" Get some work with a small station and work your way up,\" she said.\nI went back home. I couldn't get a job there, either. Then my dad told me a businessman had opened a store and needed someone to help him. But again, I didn't get the job.\nI felt really down. \" Your luck will change,\" Mom said to me. Dad lent me the car to help me to look for my job. I tried another radio station in Iowa. But the owner, a nice man, told me he had already had someone.\nAs I left his office, I asked, \"How can someone be a sports announcer  if he can't get a job in a radio station?\"\nI was waiting for the lift when I heard the man call. \" What did you mean? Do you know anything about football?\" He put me in front of a microphone and asked me to try to imagine that I was giving my opinion on a football game, I succeeded.\nOn my way home, Mom's words came back to me, \"One day your luck will change, Son. And when it happens, it'll feel doubly  good because of all the hard work you've had.\" At that moment I knew what just what she meant.",

It talks about different ways of communicating like chatting on line, sending e-mails, sending different kinds of messages and keeping an online diary.\nThe article says that people nowadays send e-mails at least once a day. I don't agree with this because I send e-mail only twice a week. However, I do check my e-mail once a day. I like receiving e-mails.\nAbout chatting online, the article says that chatting on line is becoming more and more popular among teenagers. I think this is true. Whenever I arrive at home, I turn on my computer and log on  to chat online with my friends. I prefer chatting online to calling a friend, because I can chat with many friends at the same time.\nBut I like using mobile phones.

        "How do you study each day? You may answer it in one second: have classes at school, take notes and do homework. Feeling a little bored? There are other ways that can make learning interesting and varied. It's called digital learning.\nDigital learning is a way to help students learn by using the Internet. There are three important kinds of digital learning. Apps are computer software applications  . People can download them on their mobiles. The other two kinds are social networking services, including weibo and WeChat and websites. Every one of them is like your teacher. They help you _ what you learn at school.\nCompared with traditional learning ways, digital learning has its advantages. Digital learning is also varied. It covers almost every school subject. More importantly, it always offers students the newest resources   to learn from.\nDigital learning is also personalized. You can choose what you like to learn. If you don't master what you have learned at school, you can learn again through digital ways.\nHowever, digital learning also has disadvantages. When you use digital ways to learn, you've got little chance of talking with teachers and classmates. As digital learning uses computers or smartphones, watching the screen too long may be bad for your eyes. It is better to take a rest every 20 minutes.",

        "Maybe you know floods, earthquakes, sandstorms and so on. But have you heard of typhoons?\nTyphoons are some of the worst storms, usually around the Pacific Ocean and the South China Sea. Most happen in July, August and September.\nHow does a typhoon happen? When lots of sea water gets hot in the summer sun, it evaporates  into the air. This makes the air hotter. When the air gets warm enough, it starts to move higher up into sky. Then cooler air around it rushes in. It fills the space that is left. After the air gets warmer, it starts to move quickly, making wind. The wind goes in circles and it keeps moving higher in the sky. The warmer the air gets, the quicker the wind moves. And when the wind moves faster than 30 metres a second, a typhoon begins.\nA typhoon has two parts, one is called the \"eye\". In the eye, the wind does not move so fast. The other part is the wall of clouds around the eye. Here are the strongest winds and hardest rains.\nTyphoons are very dangerous. In November this year, Typhoon Haiyan killed 5500 people in Philippines. More people are missing.\nWhat to do when a typhoon hits?\nStay inside. Close all the windows and stay away from them.\nTry to bring all of your things inside. Strong winds could even blow away your bikes!\nListen to the radio or TV for important information.\nIf you're told to go to a safer place, do it right now.",

This is what science is all about.\nTu's name \"Youyou\", came from the Classic of Poetry. The characters depict  the cheerful sounds deer make when calling for mates. Tu's finding has saved millions' lives during the 40 years. This also proves the value of her research product. The moment of joy and satisfaction when she discovered the artemisinin   in 1971 after all kinds of failures in experiments is eternal.\nTu has won some attention when she got the Lasker Award in 2011. But there is no way to compare her popularity back to the attention she is receiving today. She studied at the Peking University Health Science Center, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, from 1951 to 1955.\nLet's backtrack to 40 years ago. Tu finished the findings without using any advanced equipment, communication with outside world and papers to research. Nowadays, Chinese scientists have the passion to invent. As Premiere Li Keqiang mentioned in his letter, \"Tu's winning the prize marks China's progress in scientific and technological field\".\nTu's winning will help people come to realize that all those international publications, whether it is the Nobel Prize, SCI publishing, Nature, or Science, are all just gimmicks  of measuring  tools. The sole key is to be oneself and try one's best with confidence. There had been doubts about \"whether there would be a Chinese national awarded the Nobel Prize.\" This sort of doubts is unnecessary. The scientific awards are equal to all, as long as the research findings are good enough.\nThe fact that Tu has none of these three backgrounds also reminds us that science should be more accessible  to all. One shall be able to become a scientist no matter what kind of background he or she comes from, as long as one devotes into scientific research. They work so hard to prove the wrong way so that the future researcher will be closer to the right one.\nArtemisinin and science saved lived around the world. Tu saved the confidence of Chinese scientists, who will care less about whether a Chinese scientist be awarded the Nobel Prize in the future.\n(Translated by Shen Chen and Joanna Law from Commentary << >> , published on People's Daily, Oct.6, 2015)",

        "Lucy was walking with her family in the woods, far away from the city.  Her father helped her see all kinds of animals.  It was like going to the zoo.  They saw deer, a moose, a fox, and a bear.  The bear ran away when her brother shouted.  Lucy thought that was lucky, because she was a little scared of it.  Her father showed her a whistle to blow in case she got lost.  Her brother kept stealing it.  While they were walking down by a stream, Lucy's Mom was making sandwiches for everyone.  Lucy's brother Jim kept blowing the whistle.  He told her that he was going to steal her sandwich if he got there first.  That made her mad!  She really wanted her turkey sandwich and not a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  When their mom called, they both ran back as fast as they could.  Since Jim was older, he was faster and beat her to the picnic.  Lucy started crying.  She thought Jim stole everything!",

        "I think it's hard for a teenager to live in the modern society. For example, how to go to school is a problem I often worry about. Every afternoon, my father picks me up at the gate of the school. Many parents pick up their children, too.  Most of them drive private cars. Of all the cars, Anna's father's car is the best. Anna seems to have a very rich father. She always has beautiful dresses, shoes and bags. Besides these, she is also very beautiful. But she has no friends in school. When other students are playing, she never joins them. I don't like her because she is too perfect. It makes me uncomfortable to make friends with her. She seems to have everything.\nOne afternoon, when I went to my father's car, I saw a small thing fall out of Anna's bag.  So I called her quickly. However, she didn't look back and kept going. I felt very angry with her.\nDuring the dinner, my father asked me, \"Why do you look unhappy?\"\n\"Today I saw something fall out of Anna's bag, so called her.  But she didn't answer me. She is _ . \" said angrily.\n\"Oh, I know that girl. She has no friends and is unhappy because she was born deaf. I'm sure that she didn't hear you. \"\nWhat my father said suddenly woke me up. Because she is deaf, she does not talk or play with anyone at school.  She seems to have everything, but in fact she doesn't.\nNot everyone is perfect, even the perfect man has his weakness.",

        "One day, Harry bought a pet hamster name Tom. Tom was round and furry and had a funny smell. Harry loved it when Tom would climb up his arm and into his shirt sleeve. Every day before bed Harry would put Tom into his cage and every morning Harry would take Tom out of his cage and carry him around in his front shirt pocket during the day. Harry would carry Tom everywhere he went. Harry's favorite thing to do was to watch Tom run around in his exercise wheel. \\newline\\newlineThen one day Harry woke and to find that Tom was not in his cage. Tom had gone missing! This made Harry very upset. He looked everywhere for Tom, wondering where he could have disappeared to. Harry called his friends John, Rodney, and Bruno to ask if they knew where Tom was. They said that they didn't know. So Tom asked them if they would help him look for Tom. Only John and Bruno said \"yes\". to help Harry. After looking for Tom for two hours Bruno found Tom inside an old sock behind Harry's desk. No one knew how he got there.",

Tom's wife Marge had died many years before, so he lived alone. He liked living alone, but he missed Rachel. Tom spent most of his time working in his garden. He liked to plant pumpkins, peppers, and tomatoes. He hated peas and broccoli, so he never planted them. He liked zucchini and spinach, but he didn't have any of those plants to plant. One day Tom got a call on his phone. He picked it up and asked who it was. The voice on the other end of the line said, \"It's me, Rachel.\" Tom was so surprised he almost dropped the phone. He said, \"Rachel, is it really you? I can't believe it.\" Rachel said that she had been thinking about Tom and she wanted to make up for their fight. Tom was so happy.

I've learned some spoken language,but Thai writing is very difficult.The cooking lesson is my favourite.I'm learning all about Thai food and culture People don't use chopsticks here,but spoons and forks.When I come back,I'm going to cook you a real Thai meal.\nLast weekend we visited some temples.We also drove to Pattaya beach near Bangkok.I  thought it was great,but Sanan and Chinda say that next month they're taking me to Phuket  Island,where the beaches are even more beautiful.The month after next,we're going to travel  to Mr.Phairat,s hometown in the north of Thailand.The Phairats own land there,and they  have two elephants.I'm going to ride those elephants -- and even wash them.Sanan and  Chinda say it's really fun.\nI'm amazed by everything in this country,especially by the elephants.Elephants are an  important pan of Thai culture and way of life.They have been a traditional symbol of  Thailand for many years in times of war and peace.In the seventh century,a Thai king trained 20,000 elephants for battle.\nI'll tell you all about my Thai boxing lessons next time I write.\nLove,\nMandy",

I'm happy on the first night in America because I live with a kind family, the Edwards. It's a big family. They are very friendly to me. They help me do many things. When I want to write to my friends, they buy _ for me; when I lose my camera, they help me buy a new one.\nAfter some days, I go to another school in New Haven. I live in the Palumbos' house. There are three people in the family. I'm surprised that the parents are from two countries.\nIt is a nice trip and I'm happy to be with the two families. They will be my friends for ever .",

Mr Smith, a neighbour of his, was a blacksmith  . He used to work in his shop all day. Paul spent hours and hours watching how the blacksmith worked every day. \"Young man, why don't you try your hand to make a shoe tack  , even it is only to pass the time?\" said the blacksmith one day, \" Maybe it will be useful to you some day.\" Finally, the lazy boy began to have a try. After practicing some times, he becameskilledand could make very nice tacks.\nYears later, Paul's father died and he lost all the things because of a war  . He had to move to another country and live by himself. It happened that there were many shoemakers paying high prices to buy tacks for the shoes, because in that part of the country there was a great need of tacks for soldiers' shoes. Paul went to talk with them. He told them that he would make the tacks if they could help him find a workshop in the village. The shoemakers agreed. Then Paul made a lot of money by making tacks. \"How funny it is!\" he said to himself, \"Even by making shoe tacks, one can become rich.\"",

Then we went and bought a card.  There were a lot to choose from, some of them had pictures of kids and some of them had pictures of animals.  Daddy wanted to get one with a kid hugging his mommy but Ethan wanted the one with a cat on it, and I wanted the one with a dog on it.  We ended up getting all three.  Then we went to buy ingredients so we could cook breakfast.  On Mother's day I helped Daddy make breakfast.  We made chocolate pancakes and eggs.  It was very messy but a lot of fun.

It was the most exciting time of the year.\nWhen \"Fairtime\" came, my grandma became the busiest person of the family. Grandma was a kind, well-educated old lady. She was good at cooking. During \"Fairtime\", relatives would come to live in her house and have meals there. Grandma was always happy to look after them.\nYear after year, many people moved to big cities. There was no longer \"Fairtime\". Grandma became very old and was going a little blind. My parents and I did our best to make her life as comfortable as possible. I was at high school then. What I often did at home was to help Grandma with the daily newspaper's crossword puzzle. However, she didn't look happy. She often sat in her room for hours, without saying a word.\nTo attract people to move back, the Town Hall decided to reopen the Fair. One day, when I came back from school, I saw Grandma wearing her glasses, washing the dishes in the kitchen. With a big smile on her face, she looked excited and a lot much younger. She told me that her two of her cousins would come. \"They said they missed hometown and wanted to enjoy my food again.\"  Grandma said happily. \"They will stay here for one week and we can have a big party. That must be the busiest week I've had in years!\"\nI suddenly realized that Grandma didn't want to be looked after. She wanted to be \"useful\", appreciated and helpful.",

In a crowded city everyone knows that he or she has _ space that is only for himself or herself and for invited friends.\nPeople usually like to mark their space. Are you sitting on a beach or a train or in a library?

        "Although people everywhere seem to enjoy drinking coffee, they don't all have the same coffee culture. In Europe, for example, coffee shops are common places for people to meet friends and to talk while they drink coffee. On the other hand, places like this were not as common in North America in the past. Instead, people in North America liked to drink coffee in their homes with friends. The coffee culture in the USA changed when Starbucks  coffee shops spread across the country.\nThe first Starbucks coffee shop opened in 1971 in downtown Seattle, Washington, in the USA. It was a small coffee shop that cooked its own coffee beans. The coffee shop's business did well, and by 1981 there were three Starbucks stores in Seattle.\nThings really began to change for the company in 1981.That year, Howard Schultz met the three men who _ Starbucks. Schultz worked in New York for a company that made kitchen equipment. He noticed that Starbucks ordered a large number of special coffee makers, which caused his great interest. Schultz went to Seattle to see what Starbucks did. In 1982, the original Starbucks owners hired Schultz as the company's head of marketing .\nIn 1983, Schultz traveled to Italy. The special environment of the espresso( ) bars there caught his eyes. Back in the USA, Schultz created an environment for Starbucks coffee shops that was comfortable and casual, and customers everywhere seemed to like it. Starbucks began opening more stores across the USA. Then the company opened coffee shops in other countries as well. Today, there are more than 16,000 Starbucks coffee shops all over the world.\nHowever, that does not mean Starbucks has not had problems. In fact, many Starbucks stores have closed over the past few years. On the one hand, this is because there were too many coffee shops competing for business in one small area. On the other hand, stores in some countries closed because the coffee culture there did not match with the \"feel the same everywhere\" environment offered by Starbucks.",

They knew it was a bad idea to go on the farmer's land without his permission and would never do it again.",

        "Once upon a time, there was an old man named John. John loved to eat peaches. In fact, John's whole family, including his mother Stephanie, his father Bob, and his brother James loved to eat peaches. John would eat peaches in the morning for breakfast, in the afternoon for lunch, and in the evening for dinner. John and his best friend, Rick, shared their love for peaches. One day John and Rick started a peach farm so that they would never run out of their favorite fruit. They planted hundreds of peach trees and waited for them to bear fruit. After 6 years of waiting, 1 lonely peach finally grew on one of the trees John and Rick planted. They picked the peach and brought it home. They waited until the weekend to eat it in case more peaches grew, but none did. John and Rick were sad and confused about their farm. They planted hundreds of trees and were sure that there would be thousands of peaches for them to eat in no time. Another peach never grew on their farm for 17 years. One day, a mighty crack of thunder led to a strong storm. Lightning hit the ground over and over, and John and Rick were scared their trees might be killed. The next morning, every tree on the farm had more than 10 peaches on it. John and Rick started shouting for joy.",

Though we can not see, or hear, or feel our thoughts, they have great power   !\n2Isaac Newton was seated in his garden on a summer evening when he saw an apple fall from a tree. He began to think, and tried to find out why the apple fell. Then he discovered how the earth, sun, moon, and stars are kept in their places.\n3James Ferguson once saw the inside of his father's watch, and he wondered, \"Why should I not make a watch?\" This set him thinking and it led to a wooden clock which kept good time.\n4Walt Disney, the famous American film-maker, was often thinking of new ideas. One day, when he was in a meeting, he suddenly stopped talking, deep in thought. He looked and looked at a place high up in the room. This continued for a long time, end then he got an idea for a new cartoon.\n5Ideas come at any time, end the important thing is to think. When you meet with any difficulty, don't lose heart.

        "Carmen Arace Middle School is situated in the pastoral town of Bloomfield, Conn., but four years ago it faced many of the same problems as inner-city schools in nearby Hartford: low scores on standardized tests and dropping enrollment . Then the school's hard-driving headmaster, Delores Bolton, persuaded her board to shake up the place by buying a laptop computer for each student and teacher to use, in school and at home. What's more, the board provided wireless Internet access at school. Total cost: $2.5 million.\nNow, an hour before classes start, every seat in the library is taken by students who cannot wait for getting online. Fifth-grade teacher Jen Friday talks about different kinds of birds as students view them at a colorful website. After school, students on buses pull laptops from backpacks to get started on homework. Since the computer arrived, enrollment is up 20%. Scores on state tests are up 35%.\nIndeed, school systems in rural Maine and New York City also hope to follow Arace Middle School's example. Governor Angus King had planned using $50 million to buy a laptop for all of Maine's 17,000 seventh-graders - and for new seventh-graders each fall.\nIn the same spirit, the New York City board of education voted on April 12 to create a school Internet portal , which would make money by selling ads and licensing public school students. Profits will also provide e-mail service for the city's 1.1 million public school students. Profits will be used to buy laptops for each of the school system's 87,000 fourth-graders. Within nine years, all students in grades 4 and higher will have their own computers.\nBack in Bloomfield, in the meantime, most of the _ have been worked out. Some students were using their computers to visit unauthorized websites. But teachers have the ability to keep an eye on where students have been on the Web and to stop them. \"That is the worst when they disable you,\" says eighth-grade honors student Jamie Bassell. The habit is rubbing off on parents. \"I taught my mom to use e-mail,\" says another eighth-grader, Katherine Hypolite. \"And now she's taking computer classes. I'm so proud of her!\"",

He had a penny, a safety pin and an earring. He found all of these when he would walk through the forest in the afternoon. Bobby's uncle Arthur would always take walks with him through the forest, to make sure that Bobby didn't get in any trouble. Bobby had to be careful that people didn't see him, because the people didn't like mice. Bobby didn't understand, because people liked other animals, but would scream if they saw a mouse.

Well, to tell you the truth, it is really an eye-opening experience here.\nIn China, I had English classes five times a week since Grade Five. But I didn't know textbook English could be so different from everyday English until I came to Hotchkiss School, Connecticut. When I first studied English, I was told to say \"I'm fine.\" when people say \"How are you?\" But in the USA, I found that people say \"I'm good.\" or \"I'm tired.\"\nOne day, someone greeted   me with \"What's up?\" It made me _ I thought for a moment and then smiled because I didn't know what to say.\nSince then, I have learnt more and more differences between Chinese and American cultures. To my surprise, American girls spend a lot of time in the burning sun getting a tan  . In China, girls try every possible way to keep their skin white.\nAmerican students are hard-working like Chinese students. In China, schoolwork is almost everything, so we study hard and that's it.

As they grow up, they still believe they cannot break away. They believe the rope can hold them, so they never try to break free.\"\nHow could it be? These animals could at any time break free from their ropes.

And then on Friday, May 15, 2002, my grandpa died of cancer. I cried for seven days straight. My dad and his new wife were worried about me. So they took me to the doctor and they said that I was too sad and that I needed to find something happy and healthy to do during the day.\nI prayed to God every night saying that I was sorry for getting myself sick and I also prayed for him to take care of my grandpa. I still pray to this day. And now, at my mom's house, she has a four-year-old girl, my half-sister, Macie. And I have my step-dad , Michael, there for me. I really like Michael.

One day he was sitting on the sofa he thought to himself, \"Maybe I'll go for a ride.\" The dog put on his shoes and hat and walked out of the door.  He began riding down the street and he saw a lot of funny things.  He saw a pumpkin name Sue using toothpaste, a cat name Walt watching a movie and a bear name Phil cooking on a grill. On his drive back home he saw a rat name Randy, and a lion name Leo riding a bike. When the doggy got back home he wanted to write a book about all of the things that he saw.  He went into his office and gathered the pen and paper, sat down and began writing.  After hours of writing he felt that his leg was hurting from being bent under the table so long. He wrote his last sentence and got up to walk off the pain.  The doggy cooked his dinner, ate, then went to bed and the next day he woke up and read his story and liked what he wrote so much that he thought he would write another story later that day.",

His mother came home and put it on the table.\\newlineAfter dinner Tom cleared away the plates from the table.  It was his sister's turn to wash the dishes.  His father went to read the newspaper.  His mother began to make popcorn.  She made a big bowl of popcorn.  There was plenty for everyone.  She put lots of butter on it.  Tom was excited he went to sit on the striped rug in front of the television.  His sister came and sat next to him.  His parents sat on the couch.   The dog climbed on to the blue chair.  The movie was about cars.  Tom had a great movie night.",

        "A fish that lives in America can live out. of water for months at a time, similar to how animals got used to land millions of years ago, a new study shows.\nThe Mangrove Rivulus, a kind of little fish, lives in small pools of water. When their living place dries up, they live. on the land, said Scott Taylor, a researcher in Florida.\nThe fish can grow as large as three inches. They group together and breathe air through their skin before they can find water again.\nThe new scientific discovery came during a trip.\n\"We were travelling for fun. and one day I kicked over a log   and the fish came out,\" Taylor told reporters by telephone. He said he would make his study on the fish known to the public in an American magazine early next year.\nIn lab tests, Taylor said he found the fish can live up to 66 days out of water without eating.\nSome other fish can live out of water for a short period of time. The walking catfish found in Southeast Asia can stay on land for hours at a time, while lungfish  found in Australia, Africa and South America can live out of water, but only in a not active way. But no other known fish can be out of water as long as the Mangrove Rivulus and keep active, according to Patricia Wright, a biologist at a Canadian University.\nMore studies of the fish may tell how animals changed over time.\n\"These animals live in conditions similar to those millions of years ago, when animals began to move from water onto land,\" Wright said.",

        "This sad story happened on a cold winter evening. It was so cold and snow was falling so heavily that the roads were covered with ice and a strong wind was blowing. Being outside in such weather was very unwise. However, Peter Lee had to walk home from work. Peter walked with difficulty along a country road, the cold wind beating against his chest. He thought, \"If I wear my coat backwards, maybe, it will be a little bit warmer for me.\" He stopped walking, took off his coat, and put it on backwards. \"That's much better,\" he said to himself happily. Walking on through the thickly falling snow, he was thinking about drinking a cup of warm coffee by the burning fireplace.\nA few minutes later, a car knocked down Peter. The driver hadn't seen him soon enough. When he tried his best to put on the brakes  , the car skidded   on the icy road. The frightened driver got out of the car and ran to see how the poor man was.\nAfter a while, a police car arrived. A policeman went up to see Mr Lee who was lying on the ground. He told the driver, \"I'm afraid he's dead.\"\nThe driver was so surprised. \"This can't be the case, because I hardly touched him. Check my car carefully. There's not a mark on it.\"\nThe policeman said, \"I'm sure he's dead.\"\n\"It's impossible,\" the driver said anxiously. \"As soon as I hit him, I ran to help him. He was lying on the road, but he was breathing and there was no blood.\"\n\"Did you touch him?\" the policeman asked.\n\"Yes, but only to turn his head around the right way,\" the driver answered.",

It was very cold in the bathroom. This is why his sister brought him a coat. He was in the bathroom a long time. So, Steve started pasting a stone on the wall with glue on the end of his brush. Then he wrote the truth on this stone. He used a black pencil to write the truth on this stone, but the writing turned out blue. He did not know that his sister was watching him write the truth from the ceiling. He was upset because he always had a fear that he would have to share his secret power with his sister. It was too late, she saw that he wrote the truth on the stone. So he let her see his power. With a twirl of his long finger he magically made the toilet seat lift up.

        "It was one week before Halloween and Thomas still needed to find the perfect costume for trick-or-treating. Last year Thomas was a scarecrow, so his mother had stuffed his clothes with straw. Thomas thought that it was okay for a nine year old, but now he was ten and had to do even better. His friends Michael and Brianna were going as a ghost and angel, but Thomas wanted something that was both scary and real. Finally he came up with an idea and headed off to the store with his mother to collect the items. He picked up a black jacket, black gloves, and black cloth. After working through the whole weekend he had finally finished. When he got to school he wouldn't tell anyone what his costume was. He even kept quiet when his teacher, Ms. Frazier, asked him. The next day was Halloween, so Michael and Brianna came over to Thomas's house to meet him for trick-or-treating. They rang the doorbell and were waiting for the door to open when a wolf came running out of the bushes nearby. They both shouted and began to run, but then they heard someone say, \"wait for me\" from the same direction as the wolf. When they looked again they saw Thomas standing up and laughing. His costume was so real that it had tricked them both. \"Great costume,\" they thought, \"we'll have to do better next year\" and went off to collect candy from the neighbors.",

For hours, the zoo team tried to find a way to get Brian out of the cage without getting hurt themselves.  Charlie finally had an idea.  He was going to take a stuffed turtle from the gift shop, sneak into the cage, put the Polar Bears to sleep for a little bit, and then place the stuffed turtle where Brian was eating his lettuce.  Charlie's plan worked, but the Polar Bears woke up and weren't happy!  They took the stuffed turtle and ripped it up!

This is what she told us.\nJust like dogs, cats and other mammals, dolphins communicate by using sound, vision  , touch and taste. Each dolphin has its own signature whistle to identify itself and to call others. Dolphins don't have the ability to smell, but their hearing and eyesight are excellent.\nWe also asked Jane if dolphins have got their own language. She told us that they have and that dolphins started talking to each other from birth. They make different sounds, including whistles, squeaks and click. Sometimes they even sound like a heavy metal band!\nWe then asked Jane if any interesting experiments have been done. She told us that a very interesting experiment had been done with a mother dolphin and her two-year-old baby in an aquarium. They talked to each other over the telephone! The two dolphins were in separate tanks which were connected by a special under water system. Unfortunately the biologists couldn't understand what the dolphins were talking about because they haven't been able to decode   dolphin language yet. However, it was very clear that the dolphins knew what they were talking about.\nFinally we asked Jane if there was hope that we would be able to understand dolphins in the near future. She told us that she and her team have been listening to dolphins for more than 17 years, using special equipment to record and analyze their language. Unfortunately they haven't been able to decode it yet, but who knows -- maybe one day we'll get a phone call from a dolphin.",

And I've done so many wonderful things.\nI've taken the cable car  to the Peak Galleria  . I've been to Hong Kong Racing Museum. I've known a lot about horse racing. I've also visited Ladies' Street. In the street I bought some beautiful clothes for my mother. Last night I went to a concert. Chinese traditional music has always been my favourite. This morning I went to Ocean Park and watched the dolphins perform. Dolphins are so clever. They can jump from the water to touch a ball, sway   their bodies to music, kiss people and even do math. Mr Host is going to take me to an Italian film festival in Hong Kong Cultural Centre tomorrow. I'm so excited because I have never seen an Italian film before.

        "As a kid, I read a story of a bird. It described a male bird which takes a lot of pain to build a house and the female bird takes care of the baby in it. When the baby bird learns to fly, the whole family flies off to a different place leaving behind the beautiful nest for other birds to grow their family in it. It made me confused : How could they so easily give up their house built with so much effort?\nOne night, I got this dream. I was walking on the endless road with beautiful trees on the either side. Attracted by the greenery, I went on, then I saw a wonderful house. I explored the house. There was a sloping  roof which matched with the greenery around; the large central open yard reminded me of the activities that might have taken place there which felt lively even now. The small water body that kept the house cool added to the beauty of the house -- of course, it was all dried up now. Such liveliness turns the house into a home. People say \"THE HOME IS WHERE THE HEART IS\", and now I felt it and was attracted deeply.\nWhen I woke up from the dream, I was clear about everything. I realized what message my dream wanted to convey  me. And years later, when I chose my career, I thought of the story of the bird and my dream, then I was sure what to do. I decided to choose _ as my career. I wanted to do the same thing that the male bird in the story did, to take pain in building a beautiful house and let others stay in it. My dream comes true and the happiness that I gain now from this career is great.",

Debbie once told me about a boy in her class who liked being away from school. He would rub   the end of the thermometer   until it went up to 39degC. Then he'd put it in his mouth and his mother would think he was really ill.\nThis morning I tried doing that but it never went above 35degC and I rubbed it for ten minutes. So I held the thermometer next to the light on my desk and it went up to 40degC. I thought I'd put it in my mouth and walk downstairs like that. Then my mother would take it out and she would be worried when she saw that I was rather ill.\nThe only trouble was I didn't know the thermometer would be so hot. As soon as I put it into my mouth, it burnt my tongue! I spit the thermometer out.

He ran out of the back door, leaving behind shoes, socks and shirt as he went.\nHe flew into the water, not realizing that as he swam toward the middle of the lake, an alligator   was getting close. The mother in the house was looking out of the window and saw the two as they got closer and closer together. In great fear, she ran toward the water, shouting to her son as loudly as she could. Hearing her voice, the little boy made a U--turn to swim to his mother. It was too late. Just as he reached her, the alligator reached him. The mother caught her little boy by the arms just as the alligator pulled his legs. That began an unbelievable tug-of-war   between _ . The alligator was much stronger than the mother, but the mother did her best not to let go. A farmer happened to drive by, heard their screams, rushed from his truck and helped them.\nLuckily, after weeks and weeks in the hospital, the little boy survived. His legs were seriously scarred by the terrible attack of the animal. And on his arms, were deep scars where his mother's fingernails dug into his arms in her effort to pull the son she loved.\nThe newspaper reporter, who interviewed the boy, asked if he would show him his scars. The boy lifted the legs. And then, he said to the reporter, \"Look at my arms. I have great scars on my arms, too. I have them because my mum wouldn't let go.\"",

Gary often rode around in Albert's shirt pocket, since it would be hard for him to keep up with Albert and Lock as they walked around. One day, as they were wandering around, a storm popped up, forcing them to hurry indoors to deal with it. Unfortunately for them, they couldn't find a building quickly, so they ended up being frosted over by the dangerous weather. \"If we don't get out of this soon, I might die!\" yelled Gary, who was cold. \"Don't worry, no one's going to die!\" yelled Albert, who, as a reptile, was even worse off than Gary.

On that day people play harmless  jokes on others and then shout, \"April Fool!\" It's a \"for-fun-only\" day, so people don't buy gifts or get the day off work or school.\nApril Fool's Day started in France in the 16th century . At that time, New Year's Day was between March 25th and April 1st. When New Year's Day changed to January 1st in the mid-1560s, some people still celebrate it on April 1st. Others played jokes on them and called them \"April Fools\".\nEach country celebrates April Fool's Day differently. In France, it is called \"April Fish\". The Frenchmen fool their friends by sticking   paper fish to their friends' backs. When someone finds out this joke, they shout, \"April Fish!\" In England, it is bad luck to play an April Fool's joke on someone in the afternoon.

        "Once upon a time there was a cowgirl named Callie. Callie was the most beautiful cowgirl in all the land. She rode a beautiful horse. Her horse was brown. There are plenty of other horses. There are black horses, white horses, and red horses, but Callie's brown horse was the only horse in the world. Callie lived in a beautiful house with her husband. Her husband's name was Henry. Henry was a very good farmer. He grew tomatoes. His neighbor grew corn, potatoes, and bananas. His neighbor's name was David. David had a son named James who played in Henry's field. One day James fell and Henry almost ran him over with his horse. It was very scary. James was very careful when playing in the field. His dad told him never to play in the field again and he listened. Henry was very sorry for scaring him and sent him a basket of tomatoes.",

They made me happy.\\newline\\newlineWe even saw one place where there were giant bugs and they didn't even scare me.  In\\newlinefact, I like bugs.  But there was one place where you walked inside a big room where there\\newlinewere lots of plants and butterflies flying all over the place.  You could buy sugar water\\newlineto feed them and they could land on you.  My mom and brother were so excited to go in, but\\newlineI was scared.  I wasn't sure that I wanted to be in the room with butterflies flying\\newlineeverywhere.  My mom said I would be okay.  My brother said I would be okay.  They said\\newlinebutterflies were nice and beautiful.  They said they would not hurt me.  So I went in the\\newlineroom.\\newline\\newlineGuess what?  I was so scared when one landed on me that I went screaming for the door!\\newlineThe man watching the door to make sure butterflies did not escape or get hurt yelled at me\\newlineto stop.  He was mad at me for running out and not caring about the butterflies.  I said I\\newlinewas sorry, but I was scared.

She is the greatest person in the world, and I am not exaggerating . She is kind, funny,polite,and always willing to listen,and has been a great friend. I always recall events from our childhood. I think about the school where we met in the first grade and went on until the 5thgrade. I think about the talks we had and the things we did together. If someone wants me to describe our friendship, I'd say we have been close friends for 17 years and we never got angry with each other. It's  amazing, isn't it? I haven't been able to do that with anybody else. Sometimes I even feel guilty . I miss her more than my own brothers and sisters.

They enjoy it so much that they like to draw silly pictures on to their arms and notebooks showing footballs. Then when the teacher sees them they have to use the pink erasers to erase the drawings. One day Mark was out playing football when he tripped and hurt his knee, the next day Matthew was also playing football when he fell and hurt his arm. Both boys could not play their favorite games now. So to cheer them up, Matthew's parents bought them a new football game they could play at home. When Mark showed up to play, they had also made chocolate chip pancakes as a present to both of them, even if both of their favorite food was bacon, waffles and hamburgers. After some time both boys got bored with the game and thought to build their own. So they got some cardboard and tape and built a small table top football game. After that they were busy enough to forget their own hurt parts and had a lot of fun that day.",

        "We often praise the world of science. It explains the world and makes our lives easier with technology. One of the most exciting fields in science is artificial intelligence ( AI). This is an area where scientists are working on making machines that think like humans.\nHowever, Professor Stephen Hawking, a well-known British scientist, is not for _ kind of technology. \"The development of artificial intelligence could spell  the end of human\". He said so just after using the machine made for him. As Hawking has a serious illness called ALS, he needs an AI computer to communicate. The computer learns how Hawking thinks and suggests the words he may want to use next.\nThis kind of AI is very useful, but Hawking fears the possibility of making machines that can be smarter than humans. And it's easy to imagine how terrible things may be. We can see on TV some big killer machines that are far cleverer than us. \"Humans can't compete because of their slow biological evolution  \" said Hawking. But no everyone holds the same idea towards AI technology. \"I believe we can make good use of the technology for a long time. It will help us to solve many problems in the future.\" said Rollo Carpenter, CEO of Cleverbot in the UK.\nIn which way do you think AI is heading? Should we be hopeful or fearful?",

Kim wanted spaghetti for dinner, and a special dollhouse as her present. On the morning of her birthday, Kim's brother Jamie woke her up by pretending to be a monster and making her scream. She was tired for the rest of the day because she could not go back to sleep. Her father thought it was funny and didn't yell at Jamie for teasing his sister. Kim's other brother, Danny, came back home for her birthday, and was helping Jamie tease her. They hid behind the soda and made funny noises. They hid her shoes. They switched where her toys were and made her think she had lost them. By the time dinner was ready, Kim was upset. Then it appeared that her mother had not made the meal she had hoped to have after all. Just as Kim was about to start crying and leave the table, her brothers surprised her with a huge box. Excited, Kim tore open the box to see that it was the dollhouse she wanted. Her mother showed her she had made spaghetti like Kim wanted. Jamie said he was sorry for scaring her, and she, Jamie, and Danny hugged.",

Rachel had a daughter of her own named Melissa, but she and Tom had had a fight before Melissa was born. Because of that, Tom had never met Melissa. Tom's wife Marge had died many years before, so he lived alone. He liked living alone, but he missed Rachel. Tom spent most of his time working in his garden. He liked to plant pumpkins, peppers, and tomatoes. He hated peas and broccoli, so he never planted them. He liked zucchini and spinach, but he didn't have any of those plants to plant. One day Tom got a call on his phone. He picked it up and asked who it was. The voice on the other end of the line said, \"It's me, Rachel.\" Tom was so surprised he almost dropped the phone. He said, \"Rachel, is it really you? I can't believe it.\" Rachel said that she had been thinking about Tom and she wanted to make up for their fight. Tom was so happy. They were going to meet the next weekend. Even before he hung up, Tom could imagine himself hugging his daughter. He sat down and thought about everything he wanted to say to her.",

When he asked them how they got into racing they each had a different story to tell. Sam started with his dad when he was much younger. Mark started when he met Sam, who was racing. David started when he saw a race on TV. John was very interested in learning to race bicycles like the three men he met. So he asked them where he could buy a bike like theirs, and how much would it cost. Sam said he would give him his old bike for free. Mark told him of a store nearby, and David told him of a store on the web. John said goodbye to the racers so that they could keep going on their ride. John then went home and left Sam a note so that he could pick up his old bike. He then went to his desk to look up some stuff on bike racing. He was so excited his mother heard him from the other room shouting about wheels. He looked into the safety parts of bike riding including the wrong time to ride and the stuff he would need like, a helmet and horn.",

        "My husband and I had just opened up a pet sitting business earlier that year. Our customers had slowly risen from three to thirty a month. We were busy through those hot summer months, driving between visits. Our work was strictly done at the pet owner's home. It was almost too busy for the two of us, but we were making good money!\nWe asked pet owners new to our business to phone two weeks ahead so we had enough time to meet the owners and pets at their homes and make any following meetings before the owner leaves.\nOne day, we decided to take on a new customer just two days before they would leave. We met the family, filled in a form, and spent some time with their dog, Hercules. He playfully jumped on us and touched our hands and arms using his tongue. The family laughed as he did this, showing us that he was very loving.\nTwo days later I appeared at the house, alone. I came up to Hercules and said hello happily. I filled up his water bowl and cleaned any messes he made. Meanwhile, he was so lovely sitting beside. I thought this would be the good picture to send to the owners as usual. After the light and \"click\" sound went off, Hercules rushed at me. I didn't know what had just happened until I noticed the drops of blood. I ran out and did the only thing--calling my husband.\nThen I went to neighbors for help. My husband arrived after ten minutes. The helpful neighbor and my husband led Hercules back into his pen . Then my husband and I took off to the hospital.\nI must have looked like I was shot when I walked into the hospital. The nurses quickly moved me to a room. I asked the doctor in a weak but playful manner, \"Am I going to die?\" He replied, \"Finally.\"",

        "As Michael put each finger on the white laces of the football like his dad had shown him he thought about his school trip to the zoo tomorrow. He could not wait to get to the zoo and most of all could not wait to see his favorite animal, the lion. Aiming the football at the tire swing that hung in his back yard, he remembered the second thing his dad had taught him about throwing a football which was making sure his shoulder and the football were in a straight line before he threw it. He watched the football sail toward the tire, right as his mom called him in for dinner. His mom had made his favorite food, hotdogs. He sat in the kitchen and watched as ketchup fell on to his plate as he ate his hotdog. His mom told him that in order to get his after dinner treat he would have to eat his corn, carrots, and drink all of his milk too. \\newline\\newlineThat night as his mom tucked him in to bed he starred out the window and wondered if the lions at the zoo were looking up at the moon too. Michael, wondered if his best friends Joe, Nick, and Ryan were as excited as he was about going to the zoo the next day. He closed his eyes and went to sleep.\\newline\\newlineThe next day he hopped from one foot to the other as his class lined up to get on the bus that would take him to the zoo. On the bus he sat with Ryan. The bus driver started the engine and turned the big steering wheel leading them out on to the road. Finally, at the zoo Michael began to imagine how cool it would be to finally get to see the lion cage. First his class went to see the monkeys and then headed over to see the long necked giraffes. As their teacher announced that they would then be going to see the elephants, we wondered if he would ever get to see the lions. Finally after learning about the elephants it was time to see the lions. The lion stood on a huge rock and swung its long tail from side to side. The lion licked his lips with its long pink tongue and Michael wondered if it was thinking about having a class full of kids for its lunch.",

In den ersten vier Spielminuten lagen die Nuggets vorne oder es stand unentschieden, doch konnte Boston das erste Viertel mit einem 26:8-Lauf beenden und blickte danach nicht mehr zurück. Sie gingen mit einer 15-Punkte-Führung in die Halbzeit und führte in der zweiten Hälfte nie mit weniger als zehn Punkten. Die Celtics wurden von ihren Backcourt-Spielern der Startaufstellung angeführt.

Jared Sullinger steuerte ein Double-double mit 16 Punkten und elf Rebounds bei. Die Celtics dominierten bei den Rebounds, da sie 15 ihrer 50 nicht verwandelten Bälle (30 %) rebounden konnten und Denver nur sechs Offensivrebounds bei 39 nicht verwandelten Körben (15 %) gestatteten. Der Nuggets-Center Nikola Jokic erzielte 23 Punkte (zehn von 15 vom Feld) und war der beste Scorer auf dem Platz. Dazu kamen noch 13 Rebounds, vier Assists und zwei Steals. Emmanuel Mudiay schaffte effiziente 18 Punkte (fünf von neun vom Feld, zwei von vier Drei-Punkte-Würfen, sechs von sechs Freiwürfen), und Danilo Gallinari kam auf 17 Punkte (fünf von elf vom Feld, sieben von zehn Freiwürfen).

The angel told Bobby it could show him. Bobby would have to beat it at a game. Bobby hoped it would be checkers or chess. His dad had taught him those. He was also good at card games. Instead, the angel wanted to play rock-paper-scissors. Bobby beat the angel two out of three times, so he won. Bobby and the angel then went for a long ride. After they flew, the angel dropped Bobby back at home. It told Bobby he had to promise not to tell anyone. Bobby asked if that included his grandma, mother, brother, and father. The angel said it did. Bobby said he would. The angel left. They met a few more times and became good friends.",

Read on to learn them.\nGeneral Main Street\nBy using a special method of construction , Disneyland created an effect that you don't notice until your tired family leaves the park. The next time you enter Disneyland, make note of the distance that it appears you have to travel to get to the \"Partners\" statue. Then look at the exit of the park from the statue. That's correct. The distance appears to be shorter entering the park than going out. The purpose was to keep guests from wanting to take the long walk out.\nBirthday fun\nIf you visit Disneyland on your birthday, be sure to tell the person at the gate that it's your big day. You'll be sent to City Hall where you'll be presented with a special sticker by cast members, letting everyone know it's your birthday. You may also be able to score special items from other cast members throughout the park, so it's certainly worth a try!\nThe music never stops.\nVisitors like the music and sounds in the park.. Did you know the music never stops at the park? Even when the park was closed, the music and sounds are kept on going. Some believe it cost too much for Disney to keep turning off the music and then restarting it each day. But the truth is that it helps some workers clean up after 2 a.m!\nClub 33\n\"Club 33\" is the only place in Disneyland that provides guests with alcoholic beverages . Club 33 members and their guests get free entrance to Disneyland so long as they have a meal at Club 33 on the day of their visit.",

        "Fashion always keeps at least one eye on the future. Now scientists are lending a hand, developing tomorrow's super-powered clothing such as coats that can recharge  your MP3 player and make you stronger.\nFor example, electronics could get recharged in the future simply by plugging  them into your outer wear, because Australian researchers are designing clothing that can collect energy from a person. The coats would include small things that change vibration energy from a person's movements into electricity. High-tech fabrics would carry this energy to batteries .\n\"It will look like an ordinary(common)coat but have super energy,\" said Adam Best, an Australian head research scientist. \" _ has important uses for soldiers in the field and could mean they no longer need to carry heavy batteries,'' Best added. \"Above all, they'd be wearing the battery, not carrying it.\" Besides helping soldiers, these coats could also have common uses for common people, such as powering radios, mobile phones, MP3 players or medical things. Solar-powered handbags could do the same thing.\nThanks to self-cleaning fabrics developed by scientists working for the U. S. Air Force, underwear and sports clothing could go weeks without washing. The general idea of clothes that never get dirty can be found in the 1951 film The Man in the White Suit. The new technology helps keep off water, oil and bacteria .\nHigh-tech fabrics could also help serve as protection. For example, future fabrics could lead to soft helmets that turn hard in an accident.\nNot all the possible fabrics of tomorrow are necessarily high-tech. For example, chicken feathers  and other things of the farming industry could get changed into wool-like fabrics or cotton-like ones, helping use fewer fabrics made from oil.\nScientific development is also creating wool that doesn't become bigger or smaller after washing. And future clothing could help soldiers shoulder heavy bags and help people walk. But not all electronic coats have such uses--some might serve as video game players with high technology and the latest fashion joined together perfectly.\nThe world of fashion is set to be taken by high-tech clothing that works as you wear!",

        "In the UK, most children have their lunches at school, but in some schools, parents can choose what their children eat. The children can have a school dinner-a hot, cooked meal; or they can take a packed  lunch with them, which usually includes cold food like sandwiches.\nOften parents know what their children want. Cath, a mother of three children, told us, \"My children have packed lunches because they say they don't like to have school dinners. So I make three packed lunches every morning.\"\nHowever, another mother, Susan, made a different choice. She said, \"My daughters have a always had school dinners. I think they probably get healthier food at school than a few sandwiches I make for them.\"\nBut how healthy are school dinners? Kaz, a father, thought poorly of them. He said, \"Fizzy  drinks were offered and I think there were a lot of chips.\"\nJamie Oliver spent a year working in a school kitchen. He was worried about the unhealthy food which included burgers, pizzas and chips. So he tried to cook healthy food such as good stews and curries for the children instead.\nSo Jamie improved the school dinners, and trained the dinner ladies to cook healthy food in that school. Then he advised the government to improve school food across the country. And it seems that the changes have begun.\nAnna, a pupil, told us, \"We used to have a fast food window where you got chips and coke, but they stopped that this year. There's a salad restaurant, which is good, so it's healthier than it was.\"\n,.",

Even when friends are having a meal together, it's common for most to check their phones.\nAccording to a report by Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers, an American company, Chinese people spend about 170 minutes on their smartphones daily.\nMany students are _ to using smartphones. It does no good to their study. Research by Japan's Education Ministry showed children who spend more than four hours a day on their phones perform much worse in school test than those who play with their phones for 30 minutes.\nIt's true that the smartphone has made our lives easier. But many also think they spend too much time on it, and this is bad for their study or work. People are trying to change that.\nA new app called Forest was introduced this month. It lets users plant a seed that grows into a tree over the next 30 minutes. During the half hour, users cannot use their phones, or the tree will die.\nA restaurant in Los Angeles, US, gives people a 5% discount   if they don't check their phones during a meal.

She refuses to believe everything that she reads. \"Not everything in books is true,\" she said.\nMany other students in her school think the same thing as Li.

        "Steve had a very long finger. It was the longest finger anyone in his town had. One day Steve shut the toilet seat, and his finger got caught in it. He couldn't get it out. It was very cold in the bathroom. This is why his sister brought him a coat. He was in the bathroom a long time. So, Steve started pasting a stone on the wall with glue on the end of his brush. Then he wrote the truth on this stone. He used a black pencil to write the truth on this stone, but the writing turned out blue. He did not know that his sister was watching him write the truth from the ceiling. He was upset because he always had a fear that he would have to share his secret power with his sister. It was too late, she saw that he wrote the truth on the stone. So he let her see his power. With a twirl of his long finger he magically made the toilet seat lift up. He could make things move with his mind.",

        "Seed of Kindness\nJim, a successful businessman, told the experience of his childhood.\nWhen he was 12, his parents died. He was alone and didn't get on well with others. People always laughed at him. No one showed kindness to him.\nHis only friend was a dog named Tige. He gave his dog enough to eat and drink, but sometimes he was not polite to it. He didn't know that an unkind work sometimes could cut one's heart like a knife.\nOne day as he walked down the street, a young lady was walking in front of him. Suddenly one of her bags dropped from her arms. As she stopped to pick it up, she dropped other bags. He came to help her.\"Thank you, dear! You are a nice little boy!\"she said kindly, smiling.\nA special feeling came to him. These were the first kind words he had ever heard. He watched her until she went far away, and then he whistled to his dog happily and went directly to the river nearby.\n\"Thank you, dear! You are a nice little boy!\"he repeatedthe woman's words. Then in a low voice he said to his dog,\"You are a nice little dog!\"Tige raised its ears as if it understood.\n\"Uhum! Even a dog likes it!\"he said,\"Well, Tige, I won't say unkind words to you anymore.\"Tige waved its tail happily.\nThe boy thought and thought. Finally he looked at himself in the river. He saw nothing but a dirty boy. He washed his face carefully. Again he looked. He saw a clean nice boy. He was amazed. From then on, he had a new life.\nAfter telling this, the businessman stopped for a while, and then he said,\"Ladies and gentlemen, this is the very place where that kind woman planted in me the first seed of kindness. All of us should learn about kindness. What a great powerit has!\"",

It was just standing there, with father standing on one side, and I on the other side.\nWe were both in great anger. \"Never set foot in this house again!\" stormed father. With tears welling up in my eyes, I rushed out of the flat and ran along the street.The street lights were shining, causing rather sad-feeling. I walked around aimlessly.\nA young father who held a child in his arms walked past me. I felt as if I saw my childhood from another space: happy and carefree.\nBut now ... I don't know whether it is because I have grown up or because dad is getting old. We differ in our ways of thinking. He always put his opinions of behavior on me. Whenever I do something wrong, he never admits  it. We are just like two people coming from two different worlds. It feels like there is an iron door between us that can never be opened.\nI wandered the streets, without a destination in mind. My heart was frozen on this hot summer night. As I walked on there were fewer and fewer people on the streets, until I had only the street lights to keep me company. When I finally reached the high-rise apartment block in which I lived, I saw that the light was still on.\nI thought to myself: \"Is father waiting for me, or is he still angry with me?\"\nIn fact, it was nothing. Perhaps, dad was throwing away some of his old stamps. Perhaps he thought they were useless. I never had the courage to tell him that I liked collecting stamps.\nAll the lights were off except father's.\nDad was always like this. Maybe he didn't know how to express himself. After shouting at me, he never showed any moments of regret. However, after an argument he has the habit of _   while I am sleeping.\nThis was how he always was.He has been a leader for so long that telling everyone else what to do has become his second nature.\nThe light was still on. \"Am I wrong?\" I whispered, maybe... With the key in hand, I was as nervous as I had ever been. At last, I decided to open the door. As soon as I opened the door tears ran down my face. I suddenly realized that the iron door that I had imagined between us did not exist at all. Love--it's second to none!",

I e-mailed Chase's teacher one evening and said, \"My son keeps telling me that the thing you're sending home is math -- but I'm not sure I believe him. Help, please.\" She e-mailed right back and said, \"No problem! I can help Chase after school anytime.\" And I said, \"No, not him. Me. Hegets it.Help me.\"\nAnd that's why I stayed with Chase's math teacher. We talked about teaching children. We agreed that subjects like math and reading are not the most important things that are learned in a classroom. We also talked about something else ---- kindness and bravery.\nAnd then she told me this.\nEvery Friday afternoon Chase's teacher asks her students to take out a piece of paper and write down the names of four children with whom they'd like to sit the following week. She also asks the students to nominate  one student who they think is the most popular student that week. They needn't write down their names on the paper.\nAfter the students go home, she takes out those pieces of paper, and studies them.\nIn fact, Chase's teacher is not looking for a new seating chart or \"popular students.\" She is looking for lonely children. She's looking for the ones who are unwilling to connect with others. She is discovering whose gifts are not noticed by their classmates. Then she gets to know who needs help.\nAfter watching Columbine the wise woman realized that all violence  comes from loneliness. So she decided to start fighting violence early and often, and what she is doing is SAVING LIVES.\nAnd she finds the lonely kids through those lists and tries to help them. It's math to her.

        "Thousands of teenagers will be able to move to a new wave of \"studio schools\" at the age of 14 to improve their chances of finding a job in UK. Twelve new-style schools are open to act as a bridge to the workplace and cut the number of NEETs.\nUnder plans, schools will operate longer days and work outside standard school terms.\nEach teenager will be expected to spend between four hours and two days a week on work placements with business related to the school and a personal coach will be sent to the teenagers to act as a school \"line manager\".\nThe reforms   are put forward because of the fears that too many teenagers are finishing full-time education at present but they are short of the skills needed to succeed in the workplace. According to a recent report, more than two thirds of employers   believe school and college leavers have less important employability skills, while 55% say they are unable to manage their time or daily routine. And the number of NEETs who are not in education has hit a record high, with almost one-in-five young people being left without a job or a training place.\nThe Department for Education will tell the public the building of 12 studio schools - providing for around 3,600 teenagers - in areas such as Liverpool, Stevenage, Stock-on-Trent and Fulham, west London. Each one will be connected to the local employers. Under plans, teenagers will be able to move out of ordinary schools to attend them between the ages of 14 and 19.\nThe government said all subjects would be taught \"through projects, often prepared with employers\" - with rules such as science being connected directly to local engineering companies or hospitals. Schools will operate a longer day to give teenagers a better understanding of the needs of the workplace. Along with their studies, students will carry out work placements for four hours a week, rising to two days a week of paid work for those aged 16 to 19. They will also get the chance to take professional qualifications   connected directly to the needs of local employers.",

Animals don't need clothes!\" But no one listened to him. They said he was just out of fashion.\nHowever, _ Several times the squirrel caught his shirt on trees, stopping him in mid-jump and sending him falling to the ground from a tree. The rat couldn't go into his hole without taking off his hat first.

And the animals realized that they didn't need clothes at all. Starting to wear them had been very dangerous, and they had only done it to make others admire them, and to get attention.",

        "\"Life is speeding up. Everyone is getting unwell.\"\nThis may sound like something someone would say today. But in fact, an unknown person who lived in Rome in AD  53 wrote it.\nWe all love new inventions. They are exciting, amazing and can even change our lives. But have all these developments really improved the quality of our lives?\nPicture this. You're rushing to finish your homework on the computer. Your mobile phone rings, a QQ message from your friend appears on the screen, the noise from the television is getting louder and louder. Suddenly the computer goes blank and you lose all your work. Now you have to stay up all night to get it done. How happy do you feel?\nInventions have speeded up our lives so much that they often leave up feeling stressed and tired. Why do you think people who live far away from noisy cities, who have no telephones, no cars, not even any electricity  often seem to be happier? Perhaps because they live simpler lives.\nOne family in the UK went \"back in time\" to see what life was like without all the inventions we have today. The grandparents, with their daughter, and grandsons Benjamin, 10 and Thomas, 7, spent nine weeks in a 1940s house. They had no washing machine, microwave , computer or mobile phones.\nThe grandmother, Lyn, said, \"The more things you have, the more difficult life becomes.\" The boys said they fought less. Probably, they said, because there was less to fight over, such as their computer. Benjamin also noticed that his grandmother had changed from being a \"trendy , beer-drinking granny\", to one who cooked things.",

        "OUR children grew up on peanut butter   and jelly   sandwiches. The right jelly makes them very happy, and homemade is the only choice.\nI wasn't the jelly maker in this family. My mother-in-law was. She didn't provide a wide range of flavors  , either. It was either grape or blackberry. And since we liked both flavors, we usually picked whatever jar was at the front of the pantry  .\nIt was always there. Jelly making was just a way of life for her. She always did it, following the same habits ---from picking the fruit to setting the finished jelly on the homemade shelves.\nThis past December, my mother-in-law passed away. Among the things in the house to be divided up were the remaining canned   goods. Each of us chose from the many jars of tomato juice, green beans and jelly.\nThe other day I reached in there to get jelly for a quick sandwich, and there it was. Sitting all alone on the far side of the shelf was a small jar of grape jelly. Written on the lid with a black marker was \"GR\" for grape and the year the jelly had been made.\nAs I picked up the jar, I suddenly realized something that I had failed to see earlier. This was the last jar we would ever have from my mother-in-law's patient, loving hands. Our children had never known a day without their grandmother's jelly. It seems like such a small thing, but it was a great treasure.\nHolding that last jar in my hand, my heart traveled back to meeting my mother-in-law for the first time. I saw her crying on our wedding   day, and later, kissing and loving our children. I saw her walking in the woods or riding the wagon  . I saw her surrounded by loving children at her funeral. \nI put the jelly back on the shelf. No longer was it just a jar of jelly.

        "Today was an important day for Sam: he was going to go to the pet store and pick out a pet to take home and live with him! Sam was worried that he would not find a pet that would like him better than the other pets, but he knew he would find the pet for him. The pet store had a big, white door and Sam opened it up and heard lots of barking! He saw a nice man standing next to the dogs who said that his name was Chris. Sam said hello and petted the dogs. He really liked one of the dogs named Rocky, but Rocky did not like him. Chris said that Rocky was mean and did not like some people even when the people were very nice. Sam was a little sad, but he saw the next cage! There was a small, yellow dog in the cage named Button. Sam put his finger through the bars in Button's cage and Button licked his fingers. Sam laughed, and asked Chris to let him play with Buttons. Sam and Buttons played together in the grass outside of the store, and Sam was so happy. Buttons loved Sam, and Sam loved Buttons! Sam had some papers that he had to sign, and he showed Chris all of the toys and items he had bought to bring home with his new pet: Chris was so happy, too! Sam put his new friend on a leash and took Buttons home with him, and they loved each other very much.",

He loved to go outside and run around the streets and the city. He liked to listen to the birds chirp and watch the children draw with chalk. He was a very smart and friendly kitten.\\newline\\newlineEddy was good at many things. He was good at hopping, running and playing. The thing Eddy was best at was climbing! His claws gripped trees hard which made it easy for him to pull himself up. Anyone who saw Eddy climb might think he was part monkey!\\newline\\newlineEddy also loved his family. When he wasn't outside he liked to sit with people when they would read, play with toys and eat. Eddy was a very lazy cat! He loved to sleep most of the day, at least 12 hours!

        "\"Last week was Road Safety Week at Jason's school. All the students had to take part in a talk on road safety which was given by a police officer. The following is what the police officer said. \"\n\"Most traffic accidents shouldn't happen. They happen because people are careless. A frequent cause of traffic accidents is speed. Some people drive too quickly. This means that if they have to stop suddenly, they cannot stop quickly enough to avoid  hitting other vehicles  or people. You need to remember this when you are crossing the street or walking along the sidewalk. \"\n\"It's not only drivers who cause accidents, however. People on foot-pedestrians, and bicycle riders often cause accidents, too. Pedestrians sometimes walk out into the street without looking. You should always look on both sides before stepping into the street. \"\n\"Do any of you ride a bike? Bicycle riders can cause accidents by changing directions suddenly or without warning other road users. Before you turn left, for example, you should check behind you to make sure there aren't any cars, trucks or buses coming. You should show with your left hand to tell that you want to turn left. You should not turn until the street is clear. \"\n\"The rules of the road are very simple. If we learn them and obey  them, we should not have accidents any more. \"",

        "Now, everybody is taking _ . From your best friend to your favourite pop star, selfies are taking over Facebook and Sina Weibo. The word \"selfie\" was even named Word of the Year by Oxford Dictionaries in 2013. But why do people feel the need to take them? And are they doing us more harm than good?\nAccording to some scientists, humans have an area in their brain that controls social activity. Receiving 'LIKE' on a selfie you have posted online can be the same as someone stopping you in the street and speak highly of you on your appearance.\nThe act of taking a selfie also puts you in a position of power. You are the director and the subject of your own work of art. It helps people feel in control of their appearance and can be a powerful tool.\nBut can it go too far? Scientists warn that too much time spent on selfies can influence people's confidence, especially in teenagers. If you are spending a lot of time choosing the perfect selfie clothes, then there could be a problem.\nAt the same time, posting selfies online can harm your personal relationships. UK studies found that many people find it hard to talk to people who are often posting selfies online.\nSo next time you want to use your smartphone  to take a quick selfie, it may be better to drop it straight back into your pocket.",

        "People enjoy taking trips. But what are the reasons they leave home? One reason is for education. People travel because they want to learn more about other people and other places. They are curious about other cultures. When people are tourists, they get a quick look at different ways of living. Even a short look at another kind of lifestyle is an important lesson. On a trip, a person can learn directly by visiting museums and historic spots. What does a tourist learn who sees the art museums, visits the historical palaces and other scenic spots in Paris and shops along the River Seine? He gets a vivid picture, a real life of one of the French people. He learns about their attitudes , how they feel about business, beauty and history.\nWhat about the tourist who goes to Hong Kong? Does he get the same information that he could get from a book? He might read that Hong Kong is crowded, that there is less than 200 square meters of space for each person. But seeing and feeling the lack of space will impress him much more. He might read that there are nearly 200 vehicles for every kilometer of roadway. But the sight of so many vehicles parked along the roadside would be a much more vivid lesson. The tourist to Hong Kong will never forget the contrasts(,): the straight vertical lines of tall modern buildings and the moving lines of boats that people live in.",

It may be an unusual topic of conversation for a 13-year-old. But at Bills' school in Chicago, US, you hear it all the time.\nThe Chicago school's 420 students learn about economic . They also get a chance to make money. Each 1stgrade and 5thgrade, students learn the basics of economics and investing .\nThen in 6thgrade, they put what they've learned to work. Students join a junior group that manages the $20,000. The group, made up of 12 to 14 students, decides which stocks to buy.\nAfter graduating, students pass on $20,000 to the next 1stgrade class. They keep half of the rest of the money; the other half goes toward improving the school. They can choose to put their money in a college-savings program or take the cash.\nIn 2007, Bills suggested that her class buy the stock of the Apple computer company. This was just before the iPhone came out. \"We bought stock just at the right time,\" she says. The kids bought Google stock as it reached $400 a share. It is now worth over $500. \"It was a good buy,\" says Myles Gate, 13. He hopes to be a banker one day.\nThe school's two graduating classes of 2005 and 2006 have each earned about $10,000 in profits .",

        "Next time you're unhappy or complaining about your life, don't turn to a cheerful comedy. You might find a tear-jerking tragedy  is just the thing you need to brighten your day.\nA team of researchers at Ohio State University, US, has found sad movies can make people happier, Science Daily reported last month.\nMany people find tragedies make them realize how good their own lives are, the study showed.\n\"People seem to use tragedies as a way to reflect on the important relationships in their own lives,\" said Silvia Knobloch-Westerwick, leader of the study. \"Tragic stories often focus on themes of eternal  love, and this leads viewers to think about their loved ones and count their good and helpful things.\"\nIn the study, researchers gathered 361 college students and showed them the 2007 movie, Alonement. The movie is about two lovers who are separated  and finally die during Worid War II. Before and after the movie, the students were asked questions measuring  how happy they were with their lives. Researchers also asked them before, afier and three times during the movie to measure various emotions, including sadness.\nResearchers found that the sadder students felt while watching the movie, the more likely they were to think about real people they had close relationships with in life. This increased their happiness afier watching the movie. Knobloch-Westerwick explained that negative  moods make people more thoughtful.\n\"Positive  emotions show that everything is fine, you don't have to worry, you don't have to think about problems in your life,\" she said. \"But negative emotions, like sadness, make you think more critically about your situation. So seeing a tragic movie may make you sad, but that will make you to think more about your own close relationships and appreciate them more.\"\nThe link between watching a tragic story and feeling better has long been recognized. The ancient Greeks even had a word for the feeling of happiness afier seeing something sad that led to the modern English word \"catharsis \".\nThe study also showed that relationships are a very important source of happiness in our lives, so it is no surprise that thinking about your loved ones makes you happier, researchers said.",

Germany is becoming the most important soccer team in the world. But how has this change happened? A newspaper offers a clue: \"For over 10 years, German teams have been building in the right way.\"\nAfter Germany scored only one goal at the 2000 European Championships, Germans wondered why the country no longer produced good young players. So in 2001, the German Football League required that all Bundesliga   clubs set up schools with youth teams from Under-12s to Under-23s.\nThe clubs now spend over EUR100 million (764 million yuan) on youth development every year. And they have improved young German players enough to put them among the best in Europe. For example, Bayern Munich  player Thomas Mueller, 25, who scored five times at the 2014 World Cup, was educated in one of the schools.\nMore than anything, though, it is team work that has pushed the Bundesliga forward. Bayern is the richest team in Germany, but the team helps its rivals   when needed.\nThrough the country's World Cup performances , the German soccer tradition is doing better than ever. Germany can play on top of the world for a few years yet.",

They enjoy it so much that they like to draw silly pictures on to their arms and notebooks showing footballs. Then when the teacher sees them they have to use the pink erasers to erase the drawings. One day Mark was out playing football when he tripped and hurt his knee, the next day Matthew was also playing football when he fell and hurt his arm. Both boys could not play their favorite games now. So to cheer them up, Matthew's parents bought them a new football game they could play at home. When Mark showed up to play, they had also made chocolate chip pancakes as a present to both of them, even if both of their favorite food was bacon, waffles and hamburgers. After some time both boys got bored with the game and thought to build their own. So they got some cardboard and tape and built a small table top football game. After that they were busy enough to forget their own hurt parts and had a lot of fun that day.",

They got in his father's truck and put their bikes in the back. Father and son went to a bike path in a town near them. Trees were on both sides of the path. It was nice and warm outside, but Charles like riding on the road between the trees. There was a lot of shade. Charles saw several friends and people from school when they were riding. He got to ride with Harry and Peter. They also rode with Peter's sisters, Anne, Kelley, and Beth. His friend Paul also went by. They only said, \"Hi,\" to each other. Charles fell once. He fell after seeing a girl he liked. Her name was Claire. She came over to see if he was okay. He had a small cut on his arm. His father put a bandage on his arm and they rode back to the truck. Charles and his father stopped for ice cream. They both got sundaes and ate them when they got home. They were glad they went for a ride because it also rained on Sunday.",

        "We are all busy talking about and using the Internet. But how many of us know the history of the Internet?\nMany people are surprised when they find that the Internet was set up in the 1960s. At that time, computers were large and expensive. Computer networks didn't work well. If one computer in the network broke down, then the whole network stopped. So a new network system  had to be set up. It should be good enough to be used by many different computers. If part of the network was not working, information could be sent through another part. In this way computer network system would keep on working all the time . \nAt first the Internet was only used by the government  , but in the early 1970s; universities, hospitals and banks were allowed to use it, too. However, computers were still very expensive and yet Internet was difficult to use. By the start of the 1990s, computers became cheaper and easier to use. Scientists had also developed   software   that made \"surfing\" the Internet easier.\nToday it is easy to get online and it is said that millions of people use the Internet every day. Sending e-mail is more and more popular among young people.\nThe Internet has become one of the most important parts of people s life.",

        "There once was a giant orange farm in space. No human had ever been there before. It could not be reached by plane, spaceship, car, or any other means of travel. The farm was run by large squirrels, and was started in 1032. They owned the planet the farm was on, called Etopit. In the year 2037, one brave man named Hugo wanted to travel to Etopit to see the farm. On Earth, it was known the squirrels grew better oranges than any other animal, including rabbits, dogs, and horses. Hugo wanted to learn the squirrels' secrets and bring them back to Earth. Hugo was no normal man. He could sneeze so hard that it would send him flying into the air. Hugo put on a squirrel costume, and had his friend Ralph tickle his nose for 7 hours. Hugo sneezed so hard he flew into space and landed in Etopit. The squirrels did not know he was a human because of his costume. Hugo met Rufus and Xenon, 2 of the most power squirrels in space. He told them his name was Tiddlywink, and that he was sent by the squirrel king from Etopit's moon Rebeti to help them grow even more oranges. Rufus and Xenon told him all their secrets. Hugo wrote all of them down, then sneezed so hard he went back to Earth! With his help, Earth has now become the best place to grow oranges.",

A GPS cannot start your car, but at least you will know where you are.\nGPS, which means Global Positioning System , is a small radio receiver. It looks like a mobile phone. You can hold it in your hand, or put in you pocket. It is sometimes put into a watch or a telephone. We also find GPS devices in cars, planes, or boats. Some of these devices have electronic maps, so you know where you are. For example, in a city they can tell you the name of the street.\nThere are three parts to the Global Positioning System. The first part is the receiver. You can hold it in your hand, or have it fixed into your car, plane, etc. the second part is a group of satellites orbiting the Earth. The receiver contacts at least four of the satellites and calculates its position. The third part of the system is a network of ground stations. They are all over the world. _ control the satellites and make sure they are working well.\nSome people think that in the future the GPS will be as common as the mobile.

He didn't understand much, but he always thought he understood everything.\nOne day the teacher asked the students a question, \"When John was ten years old, his brother was twenty. John is fifteen now and how old is his brother?\"\nMr. Green answered, \"That's easy. His brother is twice as old as John, so he is now thirty.\"\nAnother time, the teacher in a science class asked, \"When it thunders , why do we always see the light before we hear the sound?\" \"But, Miss White,\" said Mr. Green quickly, \"can't you see our eyes are in front of our ears?\"\nThe third time, the teacher in a biology class asked, \"Why can fish swim in the water?\" \"But, Miss White,\" said Mr. Green quickly, \"don't you know fish can't walk on land?\"",

Sometimes it can be difficult when you find the word is not included in most dictionaries.\nLu Jialei, 14, from Hangzhou Foreign Language School, won the CCTV Chinese Character   Spelling Contest on Oct 18th, 2013. About 160 people competed. The host read a word to the contestant, explained its meaning and gave sample sentences. The contestant was required to write down the word.\nWinning the contest was a \"surprise\" to Lu. \"I was not the smartest one,\" she said. \"But I paid attention to details.\" To prepare for the contest, she and her teammates studied the Modern Chinese Dictionary for 10 days. There are more than 56,000 entries   including characters, words and phrases in it. She also had a secret weapon. She studied how Chinese characters were formed.\n\"When others paid attention to the plot of a story, she looked at how authors use words and sentences to express themselves,\" said Su Yunsheng, Lu's Chinese teacher. Su is happy to see students like Lu find the beauty of Chinese language.\n\"Besides using something Chinese and having Chinese traditional festivals, learning to write Chinese characters is also an important part of inheriting   Chinese culture,\" said Su.",

        "He was 11 years old and went fishing every chance he got from the dock at his family's cabin on an island in the middle of a New Hampshire lake.\nOn the day before the bass season opened, he and his father were fishing early in the evening, catching sunfish and perch with worms. Then he tied on a small silver lure and practiced casting. The lure struck the water and caused colored ripples in the sunset, then silver ripples as the moon rose over the lake.\nWhen his pole doubled over, he knew something huge was on the other end. Finally, he very gingerly lifted the exhausted fish from the water. It was the largest one he had ever seen, but it was a perch . The boy and his father looked at the handsome fish. Then the father lit a match  and looked at his watch. It was 10 P.M.--- two hours before the season opened. He looked at the fish, then at the boy.\n\"You'll have to put it back, son,\" he said.\n\"Dad!\" cried the boy.\n\"There will be other fish,\" said his father.\n\"Not as big as this one,\" cried the boy.\nHe looked around the lake. No other fishermen or boats were anywhere around in the moonlight. He looked again at his father. Even though no one had seen them, nor could anyone ever know what time he caught the fish, the boy could know everything by his father's clear voice that the decision could not be changed. He slowly worked the hook  out of the lip of the huge bass and lowered it into the black water.\nThe creature swished its powerful body and disappeared. The boy suspected that he would never again see such a great fish.\nThat was 34 years ago. Today, the boy is a successful architect in New York City. His father's cabin is still there on the island in the middle of the lake. He takes his own son and daughters fishing from the same dock.\nHe was right. He has never again caught such a magnificent fish as the one he landed that night long ago. But he does see that same fish---again and again---every time he comes up against a question of ethics .",

Last year Thomas was a scarecrow, so his mother had stuffed his clothes with straw. Thomas thought that it was okay for a nine year old, but now he was ten and had to do even better. His friends Michael and Brianna were going as a ghost and angel, but Thomas wanted something that was both scary and real. Finally he came up with an idea and headed off to the store with his mother to collect the items. He picked up a black jacket, black gloves, and black cloth. After working through the whole weekend he had finally finished. When he got to school he wouldn't tell anyone what his costume was. He even kept quiet when his teacher, Ms. Frazier, asked him. The next day was Halloween, so Michael and Brianna came over to Thomas's house to meet him for trick-or-treating. They rang the doorbell and were waiting for the door to open when a wolf came running out of the bushes nearby. They both shouted and began to run, but then they heard someone say, \"wait for me\" from the same direction as the wolf. When they looked again they saw Thomas standing up and laughing. His costume was so real that it had tricked them both. \"Great costume,\" they thought, \"we'll have to do better next year\" and went off to collect candy from the neighbors.",

        "Television has taken the place of schools as the main educator  in America. There are several reasons for this. First, there is the number of hours. While Americans spend about 13,000 hours in schools, they spend 15,000 to 16,000 hours in front of a TV set. Second is the age at which viewers  start watching TV. People start watching and understanding TV at about the age of 3, which is several years before they start to do school work. Finally, there is the number of viewers. About 90,000,000 young people are attending school, but most of the Americans watch TV every day.

When we knew it might be his last birthday, the whole family decided to get together for a huge birthday celebration at the nursing home.\nDad was a good storyteller and we were always his listeners. During a quiet moment, I announced it was now Dad's turn to listen to stories for a change. I wanted everyone to tell Dad what we loved about him. The room became quiet. Then one after another, people told stories from their hearts, while Dad listened with tears in eyes.\nEveryone seemed to have more than one story. Even the little grandchildren couldn't wait to tell Dad why they loved him. For a man who had been kind to so many hundreds of people in his life, here was our chance to tell him how much we love him. A few months later, at Dad's memorial service, we more fully realized what we had given to Dad that night. Those are the stories people normally tell at a funeral   after a loved one is no longer alive to hear the words. They tell stories, full of tears. But we had given those memories to Dad in his life, and we had told them through laughter, together with hugs and joy. He had them to hold and enjoyed them from time to time in his mind during his last days and months.\nWords do matter, and they are enough. We just need to say them or to speak them publicly the ones we love. That's the ways to give back love and that's our chance to celebrate a person in his or her life.",

Sam was worried that he would not find a pet that would like him better than the other pets, but he knew he would find the pet for him. The pet store had a big, white door and Sam opened it up and heard lots of barking! He saw a nice man standing next to the dogs who said that his name was Chris. Sam said hello and petted the dogs. He really liked one of the dogs named Rocky, but Rocky did not like him. Chris said that Rocky was mean and did not like some people even when the people were very nice. Sam was a little sad, but he saw the next cage! There was a small, yellow dog in the cage named Button. Sam put his finger through the bars in Button's cage and Button licked his fingers. Sam laughed, and asked Chris to let him play with Buttons. Sam and Buttons played together in the grass outside of the store, and Sam was so happy. Buttons loved Sam, and Sam loved Buttons! Sam had some papers that he had to sign, and he showed Chris all of the toys and items he had bought to bring home with his new pet: Chris was so happy, too!

And are there any ways parents can help kids stay away from bad games? US researches are trying to find answers to these questions.\nOne problem found that parents are not taking enough notice of their kids'games -playinghabits. Many games sells output controls   on the games to help parents make sure that children don't play things unsuitable for them, said David Walsh, president of the national Institute on media and the Family. Parents need to watch the games kids are playing and how much time they are spending playing them.\nThe study found that playing games too long can affect kids' health as well as their schoolwork. Almost half of all \" heavy games\" are six to 17 years old. These kids are more likely to have weight and eyesight problems than other kids. Playing too many games also affects(v)how children do in school.\nKids can ask their parents to set a time limit for playing games and remind them when the time is up.

He watched every day as the group of bananas that hung out in another basket got eaten one by one. He wished he could be taken along to work in a bag and brought along to eat. But day after day, he sat in the bowl with only his plastic friends. One day, a little boy walked over towards him and picked Paul up. Paul was very excited. The boy looked at the pear with hungry eyes. He put him up to his mouth and took a big bite. \"Ewwww!!!\" said the little boy, and he spit out the fake fruit all over the floor. He put Paul back in the bowl and ran away. Paul smiled to himself about his adventure.",

I called him several times, but each time his secretary told me that he was in a meeting and that he would call me later. So I waited and waited, but there was still no call. Three hours passing by, I became more and more impatient. I was certain that my agent didn't care about my work, and he didn't care about me. That thought beat me. I started to shout at the phone, \"Let me wait, will you? Who do you think you are?\"\nAt that time I didn't realize my wife was looking on. Without showing her surprise, she rushed in, took away the phone and pulled the lines out of the phone, and shouted at the phone, \"Yeah! Who do you think you are? Bad telephone! Bad telephone!\" And she swept it into the wastebasket.\nI stood watching her, speechless. What on earth...?\nShe stepped to the doorway and shouted at the rest of the house, \"Now hear this! All objects in this room - if you do anything to upset my husband, out you go!\"\nThen she turned to me, kissed me, and said quietly, \"Dear, you just have to learn how to take control.\" With that, she left the room.\nAfter watching a crazy woman rushing in and out, shouting at everything in sight, I noticed that something in my feelings had changed. I was laughing. How could I have trouble with that phone?\nHer unusual actions helped me realize I had been driven crazy by small things. Twenty minutes later my agent did call.

Liang taught at a primary school for seven years until her boyfriend went to America in 1969, one year after they got married.\n\"We didn't have much money,\" she says, \" so I started babysitting for other Chinese families and taking care of my own daughter at the same time.\" She also taught children Chinese at Chinese schools. What's more, she would help newly arrived Chinese families find apartments and work, and sometimes lend them money.\n\"I remember those students from China who first came in 1986. They didn't have much money, and idea of what to do,\" Liang told us. \" I then asked people in my neighborhood and my Chinese friends for donations -not only some money but also small electronic appliances needed for daily living.\"\nOne of her experiences in Dayton, Ohio made her want to make volunteering a vocation . She remembers how she once collected  two Chinese professors who had missed their flight and had no one there to pick them up. A friend told Liang about it, and she went to meet them herself around midnight. She found the men feeling lost in that strange country, where no one spoke their language. They didn't want to go to an American hotel, and didn't know how they would get to Columbus the next day. \" So I talk to them and took them home with me,\" she says, \" and today, I am still in touch with those two professors.

        "The host Boston Celtics took down the Charlotte Hornets at TD Garden on Monday, 108 - 98. Boston (26 - 15) is now 13 - 3 in its last 16 contests and has seen star point guard Isaiah Thomas ascend to a new level through his recent play. Thomas leads the NBA in scoring in the fourth quarter and posted another big final 12 minutes on Monday, scoring 17 points in the fourth to give him 35 on the night. The All-Star drained seven three - pointers and had five rebounds and four assists in what was yet another astounding night for the Celtics' star. While the game was close throughout, Boston held the lead from the second quarter and on, never allowing Charlotte to regain control of the game. A big part of the Celtics' success was All-Star center Al Horford, who quietly scored 22 points while pulling in six rebounds. Off the bench, center Kelly Olynyk came through for 15 points and nine rebounds after an extremely strong 26 - point outing in Atlanta on Friday. The Celtics also saw the return of injured shooting guard Avery Bradley, who had missed the previous week of play with an achilles injury. Bradley appeared rusty, however, going for just five points on 2 - of - 9 shooting and committing a pair of costly turnovers. Charlotte (20 - 21) fell to 0 - 5 on its road trip with Monday's loss. The team has struggled mightily after a strong 6 - 1 start to the season. Monday, however, showed some promise, as the Hornets were able to hold close to the surging Celtics. Star point guard Kemba Walker led the team with 24 points while adding four rebounds. Shooting guard Nicolas Batum was a key factor in almost every element, playing tough defense and narrowly missing a triple - double. Batum finished with eight points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists. Big man Marvin Williams caused problems for the Boston frontcourt with his athletic scoring touch, finishing the night with 21 points. The Celtics will host the Knicks on Wednesday, while the Hornets will host the Trail Blazers.",

China had its worst accident in industry on a Saturday in 2014.\nThe accident happened in Kunshan city, Jiangsu Province in China. And the explosion was from Zhongrong Metal Products Company, who makes car wheels for the U.S. The Kunshan government told us 264 workers were there when the explosion happened and 44 died at once. \"We heard a really loud explosion at about 7 a.m. this morning, so we rushed out of our rooms, \" said Zhou Xu, a 26-year-old worker at that company. Another worker said, \"First the ambulance came and then many wives rushed to the factory to see if their husbands were okay.\"\nNow, Shanghai government is sending doctors to Kunshan to save the wounded. And the doctor said the number of the dead may increase.\nChinese government is looking into the cause of the disaster. And President Xi also paid special attention to it. He said, \" Those who are found responsible  must be punished.\"",

After he made a lot of money, he decided to spend a holiday in an excellent hotel in a big town.\nWhen lunchtime came on his first day there, he went to eat it in the restaurant of the hotel in his new clothes. The headwaiter showed him to the table, took his order and went away. When he returned and looked at the farmer again, he was surprised. The farmer had tied his table cloth round his neck.\nThe headwaiter immediately told another waiter to go to the farmer and tell him that people mustn't do such a thing in his restaurant.

        "Joey went to the doctor yesterday. He was a little scared because he might have to get a shot, but his mother promised that it wouldn't hurt. During the time they were in the waiting room, Joey played with some blue and green blocks and some toy cars that the doctor kept there for the children who came to see him. He also met another little boy named Bobby who also had to see the doctor. Bobby liked playing with the cars more than the blocks, but Joey liked playing with both of them. Joey also met a little girl named Sandy who was playing with some dolls the doctor also had for the children. When it was Joey's turn to see the doctor, his mother led him into one of the rooms and had him sit on a yellow chair. The doctor was a friendly man who wore glasses. He took Joey's temperature and looked in his ears, then asked him a few questions about how he had been feeling. When Joey said his throat hurt a little, the doctor took a look at it as well. He said everything looked okay, and Joey wouldn't need any shots this visit. On the way out Susan the nurse let Joey take a red lollipop from a basket on her desk. By the time Joey got home, he thought the doctor wasn't so scary after all.",

        "As we all know, the ocean moves. But waves breaking on the beach make the ocean fun. When you stand on the shore and look at the waves, it seems like the water is moving towards you. But the water is not really moving forward. The moving you see is wave energy. And wave energy comes from the wind.\nLet's think about how this works. As wave energy passes through the water, the energy makes particles   of water move up and down. Just give you an example of a wave passing under a basketball. We put a basketball on the sea. When the wind blows, a wave comes from behind the basketball. The basketball moves up to the top with the wave. Then the wave continues and leaves the basketball behind. The basketball looks lower, but it doesn't move forward. That's because the wave energy just moves the water which is under the basketball.\nSo why can you see a wave knock you down on the shore?When a wave moves toward the shore, the bottom of the wave slows down because _ meets the ocean floor. But the top, which is called crest , keeps moving. The different action causes the wave to fall over or break onto the shore. If a wave is very large, it carries a lot of energy when it hits the land. As time goes by, waves can break up and carry away the rocks and other things on the shore. Shorelines are changing all the time because of wave action.",

It was not easy to invent such a game because it had to be played indoors , and the court   was not very large.\nDr. Naismith thought for a few days and invented a kind of ball game. It was a fast, wonderful game with much moving and passing of the ball. It was played between two teams. To make a score , the ball had to be thrown into the basket ten feet  above the floor on the wall . At each end of the court there was such a basket.

        "On Thanksgiving Day, a teacher asked her class of firstgraders to draw a picture of something they were thankful for. She thought that these children from poor families actually had little to be thankful for. And she found most of them drawing pictures of flowers or tables with food. The teacher was very surprised to see the picture Douglas handed in. It's a hand,a simple hand.\nBut whose hand? The class were very interested in the strange picture. \"I think it must be the hand of God that brings us food,\" said one child, \"A farmer's,\" said another, \"Because he grows beautiful flowers. \" Finally when the others were at work ,the teacher went over to Douglas' desk and asked whose hand it was. \"It's your hand, Teacher,\" he said quietly and shyly.\nShe remembered that she had often taken Douglas, a dirty lonely child, by the hand while having a class break. She often did that with the children. But it meant so much to Douglas. Perhaps this is everyone's thanksgiving,not for the material things we get,but for the chance,in whatever small way, to give to others.",

He was licked again!\\newline\\newline\"Oh, Boscoe!\" the little boy said with joy as he kissed his furry little brown dog. The dog had been Scott's friend for as long as could remember. They went on many adventures together.

Boscoe was walking next to the shore and started barking his head off! Scott wasn't sure what he was barking at, so he got off his bicycle and ran down into the river to see what all the noise was about. \\newline\\newlineAll of the sudden, Boscoe fell in the water and was taken down stream with the fast water. Scott yelled, \"Boscoe!\" and he was off. He jumped into the water and began swimming after Boscoe. Boscoe's little legs were doggy paddling as fast as they could, but had no hope! Finally, Scott caught up to him, but he couldn't get back to the side of the river!\\newline\\newlineAs Scott was thinking this was the last of him and Boscoe, a large stick from a fallen log was well in reach and Scott grabbed it and using all of this might, he pulled him and Boscoe out of the river. \\newline\\newline\"Boy, was that close!\" Scott yelled out loud!\\newline\\newlineThat was the best adventure ever!",

During the week we climbed four different mountains. The best day of the trip was the last day. On the last day we heard that one of best things to do was to climb the last mountain at night so that way you could watch the sunrise on top of the mountain. We had to wake up at two in the morning to do the climb. It was very tough to climb a mountain at night. We finally got to the top of the mountain at five in the morning. We watched the sunrise an hour later at six in the morning. It was very beautiful. In fact, at one time because of the rise of the mountain you it was daytime in front of us and nighttime behind us.

        "What is the sky? Where is it? How bright is it? What lies above it? These questions are difficult to answer, aren't they?\nIs the sky blue? The sky has no color. We know that there is air around the world. When planes fly, they need air to lift their wings. Planes can't fly very high because the air gets thinner when they go up higher. If we go up about 1,200 kilometers from the earth, we'll find no air there.\nWhen we talk about the sky, we usually mean the atmosphere around the earth. It is like a very thick \"cover\" over the earth and keeps it warm. Without the \"cover\", the earth would be a very cold place and nothing could live on it.\nLooking up above us, you will see the blue sky with white clouds. It is usually light blue, but the sky would be dark blue if you go to the top of the highest mountains. And you will see fewer clouds between you and the sun.\nAnd if you sit in a spaceship high above the earth, there is no air at all. The sky would be so dark that its color would be black.\nSometimes the sky doesn't look blue. When the sun rises and falls, you will see red, orange, and other colors in the sky. These are the most beautiful moments of the day.\nNow you may understand that we see colors because the air scatters   the sunlight. Light travels through the air. Without air, there would be no light and no colors.",

One day in December, Mrs. Scott told us that we were going to make a snowman. We were excited! We wanted to see a snowman. We knew how a snowman looked. We knew a snowman was made of three snowballs. A snowman had to have a carrot nose and black eyes and buttons. A snowman had a hat and a scarf. We knew all these things. \\newline\\newlineMrs. Scott asked us to bring everything we needed to our classroom to make a snowman. Jimmy said, \"I can bring the hat and the scarf.\" Anita said, \"I can bring a carrot for the nose.\" Selma said, \"I can cut out some black circles for the eyes and the buttons.\" Ricky asked, \"But who can bring the snow?\" \\newline\\newlineMrs. Scott said, \"I know what to do.\"\\newline\\newlineThe next day all the children brought the things for the snowman.

He was a very smart and friendly kitten.\\newline\\newlineEddy was good at many things. He was good at hopping, running and playing. The thing Eddy was best at was climbing! His claws gripped trees hard which made it easy for him to pull himself up. Anyone who saw Eddy climb might think he was part monkey!\\newline\\newlineEddy also loved his family. When he wasn't outside he liked to sit with people when they would read, play with toys and eat. Eddy was a very lazy cat! He loved to sleep most of the day, at least 12 hours!

        "The keys to reaching or staying at a healthy weight are regular exercise and good eating habits. Teens should get 60 minutes or more of physical activity a day. Note the word \"activity\". As long as you're getting your body moving, it doesn't have to mean doing difficult exercise or going to the sports hall every day. All that matters is that each week you get the right balance of activity, including aerobics  , strength building, and flexibility   exercise. Make exercise a habit by arranging some time every day.\nOn days when you have soccer practice or an aerobics class, you may have no trouble exercising for an hour or more. But most of us are busy, and 60 minutes a day for exercise seems like a lot of time. The good news is that it's OK to divide it into shorter exercise breaks throughout the day.\nJust as you might have a healthy snack to stop yourself from getting hungry, exercise snacks can keep energy levels high. So get up 15 minutes early and do some stretching   activity. Walk fast or run slowly for 15 minutes after lunch. Do the same thing after school -- or walk or bike home. Add to that taking the stairs, PE class, and walking between classes during the day, and you've probably reached your 60 minutes.\nHere are five simple ways to make an exercise lifestyle change:",

He has been heading for Australia with only birds, fish, and sharks ever since.\nCrossing the Pacific is only part of his journey. Eruc has decided to go all the way around the world using his own energy. He will row, bike, walk and climb the world without help from any motors  at all. His plan includes climbing the tallest peak on six of the continents  along the way.\nFor the first part of his trip, he bicycled 5,546 miles from Seattle, Washington to Mount McKinley in Alaska and back, walked 67 miles to base camp and climbed 20,320 feet to McKinley's peak. Now in the second part of his adventure , he is rowing to Australia.\nWhy would he try to go around the world this way? He explains that he wants to encourage kids to dream their dreams and get to their own goals. He wants to show kids that there might be hard parts along the way, and sometimes they might not even get to that final goal. But they can have adventures and learn a lot along the way.\nWhen his trip around the world takes him across land, he enjoys meeting people---especially children. He has already visited many schools and shared his story. Eruc encourages all kids to set their eyes on a goal and not give up. He says, \"with goals, we will make progress, and we will be farther along than when we started, even if we don't get to some goals.  That's called life!\"",

You may find out what they are if you watch someone make friends.\nHere is how one new teacher made friends with the students in her class on the first day of the school. When the bell rang, the teacher smiled at all the students. Then she said, \" Good morning! How nice it is to have all of you in my class this year! I want to know each of you very much. I am sure we will enjoy working together.\"\nThe teacher smiled, used a pleasant voice, and acted in a friendly way. She told the students her name and wrote it on the blackboard. Then she told them something she liked to do and hoped to do with them during the year. The students knew that she liked many of the same things they liked. _ Each of them wanted to know her better and be her friends. Then she let the students tell something about themselves. So they felt that the teacher knew them. Could you make friends as the teacher did?\nHow do you know and like your classmates? One way is to find out more about them. During the break you can talk to them. You may ask them their names and the names of the schools they went to last year. They want to know about you, too. You may tell them about your interests or your holiday experiences. It is often easy to be friends with people who have the same interests and play the same games. As you talk, the others may be thinking, \" I like to do the same things you do. It should be fun to be friends with you.\"\nRemember!

David started when he saw a race on TV. John was very interested in learning to race bicycles like the three men he met. So he asked them where he could buy a bike like theirs, and how much would it cost. Sam said he would give him his old bike for free. Mark told him of a store nearby, and David told him of a store on the web. John said goodbye to the racers so that they could keep going on their ride. John then went home and left Sam a note so that he could pick up his old bike. He then went to his desk to look up some stuff on bike racing. He was so excited his mother heard him from the other room shouting about wheels.

They want to log on   to their microblogs   to check the funny things that have happened in the last hour.    Since last year, the trend   of microblogging has swept the country. Recent surveys show that most students in middle schools have a microblog, and some even update  their blogs over five times per day.\n\"We learn many fresh and interesting things on microblogs and they have become popular topics in class,\" said Liang Jianmin, 14, a student at Harbin No 3 Middle School. \"If you do not know about them, you are out of the loop  .\" It is also a great place for students to _ stress. \"My parents always ask me to study hard, and encourage me before exams, but actually it adds pressure  ,\" said Zhang Yazhe, 15, a student in Luohu Foreign Languages School. \"When I share these feelings on my microblog, I get many replies from friends in the same situation, which makes me feel better.\"  But parents are worried that microblogging could be a waste of time. Some misleading  messages may even cause danger to kids, they said.\nShen Mingde, a professor at the China Education Association, suggests parents not worry too much as long as kids are not crazy about microblogging. Instead, it can become a window for parents to understand their children.\n\"If parents can read their children's microblogs, they'll know their thoughts, thus   leading to better communication and solutions to problems,\" he said. Micro blogging tips for kids\n1. Don't microblog for more than one hour a day.\n2. Never microblog in class.\n3. Try to talk face to face with people instead of just microblogging.\n4. Be critical  . Don't trust all the messages on a microblog.",

        "\"What's the name of our neighbor? I can't remember right now. \" Have you ever heard your grandparents ask questions like this sometimes? Usually, we think that older people's memory becomes bad because their brains get weak. But now a team of scientists at the University of Tubingen in Germany has a new idea.[\n\"The human brain works slower in old age,\" says Michael Ramscar, the lead scientist. \"But only because they have stored more information overtime. \"\nThe findings are based on a series of computer simulations of learning and memory. Scientists let the computers read a certain amount of words and learn new things each day. When the computer \"reads\" only so much, its performance on cognitive tests is similar of a young adult. But if the computer learns the experiences we might encounter over a lifetime, its performance is similar to that of an older adult.\nOften it is slower, but not because its processing capacity has declined. Rather, increased \"experience\" has caused the computer's database to grow, giving it more data to process-which takes time. This is similar to old people. Imagine a person knows two people's birthdays. Another person knows the birthdays of 2000 people, but can only match the right person to the right birthday nine times out of 10. Can you say the first person has a better memory than the second person?",

        "This is a tale of two friends --- one is blind, the other has no arms. On their own, the two are \"disabled\". But together, they are a powerful team that has changed part of their village in North China's Hebei Province into a rich, green forest. Meet 53-year-old Jia Haixia and Jia Wenqi!\nTheir story began in 2000, when Haixia, who was already blind in his right eye, lost his left one after an illness. Wenqi lost his arms in an accident when he was just three. Neither\ncould find a job, so the two decided to team up. They rented some poor land and began to plant trees. In return, the local officials paid them a small fee. Haixia and Wenqi never imagined that they would end up creating an environmental paradise. Their forest now has over 10,000 trees, hundreds of birds and many other wild animals. In addition, it saves the village from river flooding during the rainy season. When the friends work together, they focus on their strengths not their disabilities. Their day begins at 7 a.m. when the sightless Haixia carries Wenqi across the river to get to their worksite. Since they cannot afford to buy young trees to plant, the two use branches from existing trees. Haixia climbs to the tree-top and with Wenqi's direction, selects the perfect branch. He then digs a hole and carefully plants it. Finally Wenqi waters the area.\nThough hard-working, the men don't make much money. But as Wenqi puts it, \" _ .\"\nNeither Haixia nor Wenqi cares about money. Together, they already have everything they need --- a perfect pair of eyes, two strong hands, and the best friendship in the world!",

He asked his sister why he thought he could not roar. His sister said they need to go talk to their friend the squirrel. The squirrel lived in a tree with a nice door mat outside. The squirrel said to the lion if he wanted to start to roar instead of meow, then he need to run faster than the other lion's.

How do you deal with your computers, MP4 players and mobile phones when they're broken or you want a new one?\nMost people just throw them away. With the development of electric industry, e-waste pollution has become a serious problem. According to the United Nations, in 2014, people around the world produced 41.8 million tons of e-waste and only recycled 6.5 million tons. The US was the biggest waster, producing 7.1 million tons. China came second, with 6 million tons.\nIt's important to pay attention to e-waste. It can either be valuable or harmful , depending on how we deal with it. E-waste is a valuable urban mine . The value of the metals, like gold and silver in the waste around the world, is amazing. And the metals can be reused. But if people throw them away, the toxic chemicals  can get into the earth or air, effecting the environment and people's health.\nApple, for example, now recycle people's used products in China when they are buying new ones. The company will test and repair the used ones and sell them at lower prices. To help reduce e-waste, we can also take computers and phones to see if companies offer recycling programs.",

        "Trains have long been an important form of transportation. Yet they have changed a lot since 1804, when the first train moved at 8 km/hr. Today's high speed trains can go 300 km/hr or faster. Besides their speed, they have many advantages over other transportation types.\nJapan built the world's first high speed railway. In 1964, Japan's \"Shinkansen\" trains started traveling between Osaka and Tokyo at 200 km/hr. Over time, more lines, as well as faster trains, were built.\nKorea, England, and the USA, now have their own high speed systems. Taiwan Province's started running in 2007. Its trains are based on two types of Shinkansen trains. They can carry 989 people and travel from Taipei to Kaohsiung in less than two hours.\nThese systems are expensive to build, but they have many advantages. For example, they are good for the environment. Trains on the London to Paris line create 1/10 the pollution that planes create. High speed trains are also safer and cleaner than cars.\nSuper fast trains can even help a country's economy . They make it easier to travel to faraway places. That helps businesses and land values in those areas. It's no wonder so many countries are building their own high speed railways.",

The farm was run by large squirrels, and was started in 1032. They owned the planet the farm was on, called Etopit. In the year 2037, one brave man named Hugo wanted to travel to Etopit to see the farm. On Earth, it was known the squirrels grew better oranges than any other animal, including rabbits, dogs, and horses. Hugo wanted to learn the squirrels' secrets and bring them back to Earth. Hugo was no normal man. He could sneeze so hard that it would send him flying into the air. Hugo put on a squirrel costume, and had his friend Ralph tickle his nose for 7 hours. Hugo sneezed so hard he flew into space and landed in Etopit. The squirrels did not know he was a human because of his costume. Hugo met Rufus and Xenon, 2 of the most power squirrels in space. He told them his name was Tiddlywink, and that he was sent by the squirrel king from Etopit's moon Rebeti to help them grow even more oranges. Rufus and Xenon told him all their secrets. Hugo wrote all of them down, then sneezed so hard he went back to Earth! With his help, Earth has now become the best place to grow oranges.",

        "With the development of science, more and more students don't like taking notes by hand. Instead, they use digital   cameras to take pictures of the words that their teachers write on the blackboard or record what their teachers say in class.\nThe children might think there are too many notes to take or their teachers write or speak so fast that they can't take more specific notes. They are trying to find ways to make things easier, so they use digital cameras. In fact, children are very clever to make use of technology  .\nBut do digital cameras really make taking notes easier?\nNot really. Before you read notes from digital cameras, there are a lot of things you have to do. To begin with, you have to find a computer. Then you need to copy the photos into the computer. Next, you have to find a printer   to print the photos. Another thing is that you can't hear the sound from the digital cameras clearly because there is usually lots of _ . You will have to listen to it slowly several times before you understand everything.\nIn fact, taking notes by hand has many advantages. For example, it can help you remember and understand what you are learning. In order to save time, you can choose the most important things or the things you don't understand to write down. You don't have to write down everything.\nDon't be afraid to take notes by hand. It's really an effective   way.",

        "When I began to move to Auckland to study the law, my mother was a little worried about the uncertainty of living in a place that was so different from India, where we lived. She worried about the shortage of jobs and the cultural differences that I would face.\nI came to New Zealand in July 2013. I found the people were very nice and supportive. Soon after I arrived, I realized the importance of getting a part time job to make a living.\nDeciding to do this on my own, I spent a whole day going from door to door for a job. However, I received a little or no reply. This became my daily activity after college for a few weeks.\nOne afternoon, I walked into a building to ask if there were any job chances. The people there were very surprised, and advised me not to continue my job search in that way. As I was about to leave, a secretary in the building came up to me and encouraged me to stay confident. He then offered to take me to the Royal Oak area to search for a job.\nAlong the way, I realized I had run out of copies of my resume  . The man stopped at his friend's office to make me 15 extra copies. He also gave me tips on dressing and speaking. I handed out my resume and went home. The following day, I received a call from a store in Royal Oak offering me a job.\nIt seemed that the world always gives back to you when you need it.

        "['Die New Orleans Pelicans (42 - 35) schlugen am Dienstag die Golden State Warriors (63 - 15) im Smoothie King Center in New Orleans mit 103:100. Am Ende des Spiels gab es Freiwürfe für die Pelicans. Tyreke Evans verwertete 17 Sekunden vor Schluss einen von zwei und brachte sie mit einem Punkt in Führung, dann konnte Anthony Davis nur 10 Sekunden vor dem Ende zwei von zwei verwandeln und sie mit drei Punkten in Führung bringen. Stephen Currys Wurf, mit dem er mit der Schlusssirene ausgleichen wollte, ging daneben und brachte den Pelicans einen wichtigen Sieg. Damit überholten die Pelicans die Oklahoma City Thunder im Rennen um den achten und letzten Playoff-Setzplatz im Westen. Die Thunder erlitten, ebenfalls am Dienstag, eine schmerzhafte Niederlage gegen die Spurs, womit jetzt die Pelicans einen Vorsprung von einem halben Spiel vor den Thunder aufweisen und nur mehr fünf Spiele zu absolvieren haben. Das Frontcourt-Duo Anthony Davis und Quincy Pondexter war dafür verantwortlich, die Pelicans zu diesem wichtigen Sieg zu führen. Davis beendete das Spiel mit 29 Punkten (zehn von 21 vom Feld, null von zwei Drei-Punkte-Würfen, neun von zwölf Freiwürfen), zehn Rebounds und vier Blocks, während Pondexter aus sechs verwandelten von sieben Würfen vom Feld und vier von vier von der Drei-Punkte-Linie auf 20 Punkte kam. Seit Mitte März hat Davis seine Leistung stark verbessert, um sein Team in Reichweite eines Playoff-Platzes in der umkämpften Western Conference zu bringen. In seinen letzten zehn Spielen erzielte er im Durchschnitt 25 Punkte, neun Rebounds und drei Blocks, womit seine starke Leistung in diesem Spiel keine Überraschung darstellte. Pondexter erreichte die 20-Punkte-Marke erst zum zweiten Mal in dieser Saison, was zur rechten Zeit für die Pelicans in ihrem hitzigen Kampf gegen die Thunder um diesen letzten Playoff-Platz kam. Tyreke Evans steuerte ebenfalls ein bisschen von allem bei. Er schaffte insgesamt zwölf Punkte (vier von acht vom Feld, vier von fünf Freiwürfen), sechs Rebounds, neun Assists und vier Steals, was zwar unter seinem Saisondurchschnitt lag, trotzdem aber eine produktive Leistung des Guards darstellte. Draymond Green und Stephen Curry taten ihr Bestes, um die Warriors auf Siegeskurs zu halten. Curry kam auf 25 Punkte (neun von 18 vom Feld, fünf von acht Drei-Punkte-Würfen, zwei von zwei Freiwürfen), sechs Rebounds und neun Assists, während Green 24 Punkte (zehn von 18 vom Feld, drei von sieben Drei-Punkte-Würfen, einen von zwei Freiwürfen) und 14 Rebounds erreichte. Curry verpasste einige wichtige Würfe gegen Ende des Spiels, übertraf aber dennoch die 20-Punkte-Marke zum neunten Mal in seinen letzten zehn Spielen. Green hatte in letzter Zeit einige Probleme und verwandelte in seinen letzten zwei Partien nur vier von 18 Würfen vom Feld und einen von sechs von der Drei-Punkte-Linie. Dieses Spiel war für ihn also ein Schritt in die richtige Richtung und erhöhte seine Saisondurchschnittswerte auf zwölf Punkte und acht Rebounds. Die Überraschung des Abends war Klay Thompson, der kaum einen Wurf im Korb unterbrachte. Er kam nur auf zwei verwandelte von zehn Würfen vom Feld und einen von fünf von der Drei-Punkte-Linie für sieben Punkte, seine zweite schlechte Leistung hintereinander. Am Sonntag gegen die Spurs hatte er nur drei von elf Würfen vom Feld verwandelt, muss sich also vor dem Beginn der Playoffs nächste Woche noch steigern. Im nächsten Spiel treffen die Pelicans am Mittwoch auswärts auf die Memphis Grizzlies, während die Warriors am Donnerstag zuhause auf die Portland Trail Blazers treffen.']",
