- The current population of the town is 10,000.
- The birth rate is 2% per year.
- The death rate is 1% per year.

To calculate the population 5 years from now, we need to find the net population growth rate per year and then multiply it by 5 years.

Net population growth rate per year = Birth rate - Death rate
                                = 2% - 1%
                                = 1%

Population after 5 years = Current population × (1 + Net growth rate)^5 years
