        "Topic_section": "Introduction",
        "Rationale": "Eruptive activity at Newberry Volcano began about 600,000 years ago and has continued into the Holocene, the last eruption taking place 1,300 years ago. Unlike other shield-shaped volcanoes, which often erupt basaltic lavas only, Newberry Volcano has also erupted andesitic and rhyolitic lavas. A popular destination for hiking, fishing, boating, and other recreational activities, the volcano lies within of 16,400 people and within of nearly 200,000 people, and it continues to pose a threat to life. Still considered an active volcano, it could erupt and produce lava flows, pyroclastic flows, lahars (volcanically induced mudslides, landslides, and debris flows), ashfall, earthquakes, avalanches, and floods. To track this threat, the volcano and its surroundings are closely monitored with sensors by the United States Geological Survey.",

        "Gold_passage.text": "The surrounding area has been inhabited by Native American populations for more than 10,000 years. The volcano contains a large caldera, in diameter, known as the Newberry Caldera. Within the caldera are two lakes: Paulina Lake and East Lake. The volcano and its vicinity include many pyroclastic cones, lava flows and lava domes; Newberry has more than 400 vents, the most of any volcano in the contiguous United States. Glaciers may have once been present at the volcano, though this remains contested. The area has a dry climate with low precipitation levels and little surface runoff. The origin of the volcano remains somewhat unclear; while some scientists believe it originated from an independent hotspot, most evidence indicates that it formed from the subduction of the oceanic Juan de Fuca and Gorda tectonic plates under the continental North American Plate."

        "document_str": "\nСПИН в Африка и черна Америкаавтор: Куей Керти, 11 октомври, 2012 г.Преди тридесет години Центърът по контрол на заразите огласи първите случаи на ХИВ/СПИН в Ню Йорк и Лос Анджелис. Първоначално смятана за болест на белите мъже гейове, сега СПИН е глобална епидемия. Тридесет и три милиона души по света живеят със СПИН през 2010 г., като субсахарска Африка поема основния удар.От началото на епидемията над 600 000 души са умрели от СПИН в Съединените щати, 1,2 милиона души в момента живеят с ХИВ. Около една пета от тях не знаят за инфекцията си и представляват риск за по-нататъшното предаване на вируса. В Съединените щати прогнозите предвиждат равнището на инфекции да достигне приблизително 56 000 души на година.СПИН в АфрикаСмята се, че вид маймунски вирус на имунната недостатъчност (СИВ) сред редица колонии на шимпанзета в Камерун е вирусът-предшественик на ХИВ-1, който причинява СПИН при хората. Твърдението, че ХИВ произлиза от Африка, е политически чуствително, защото мнозина вярват, че западните учени обвиняват фалшиво Африка за болест, която всъщност започва в Съединените щати. Независимо от произхода си, ХИВ/СПИН се превърна в остра епидемия в Източна Африка през 80-те години. В Найроби, Кения, разпространението на ХИВ сред проституиращите нарасна 15 пъти между 1981 и 1985 г. Африканските доктори се изправиха пред признаци и симптоми, подобни на тези, наблюдавани при белите американски гейове, но 80 % от случаите в Африка се дължат на хетеросексуалната активност, като засягат повече жените.Първоначалната реакция на африканските правителства срещу СПИН кризата беше неадекватна, а в някои случаи изобщо липсваше. В Южна Африка, където епидемията стана най-голямата в света с повече от 5 милиона човека, заразени с ХИВ, белите лидери отказаха да въведат програма за СПИН образование. Те не предвидиха опасността от мащабната хетеросексуална ХИВ/СПИН епидемия до края на 80-те години.Световната здравна организация първоначално се отнасяше към ХИВ/СПИН в Африка като сравнително маловажен проблем  в сравнение с маларията, но до 1993 година, когато приблизително 9 милиона субсахарски африканци бяха ХИВ позитивни, стана ясно, че това е голяма криза. До края на 90-те години лечението с тройна комбинация от антиретровирусни лекарства (АРВ) действително промени положението в западните страни, но цената за африканците беше невъзможната сума от 10 000 до 15 000 долара на човек за година. Южна Африка започна да лобира пред безкомпромисните мултимилардни фармацевтични компании да позволят лекарствата да се произвеждат на място. През декември 1999 г. президентът Бил Клинтън обяви пред затворена конференция на Световната търговска организация в Сиатъл, че Съединените щати ще търсят гъвкавост в патентните закони, които държат високи цени на лекарствата. През 2000-та година и след това цената на АРВ намаля. Но бяха изразени съмнения, че африканците ще могат да се придържат към многодозов антиретровирусен режим. В изявление, което беше доста критикувано впоследствие, началникът на USAID Андрю Нациос каза в интервю за Бостън Глоуб, че \"африканците не знаят какво е западното време. Много хора в Африка никога не са виждали обикновен или ръчен часовник през целия си живот.\"През 2003 г. президентът Джордж Буш обяви безпрецедентния Президентски спешен план за облекчаване на СПИН (ПСПОС), чиято цел беше да помогне за спасяването на живота на страдащите от ХИВ/СПИН по света. Чрез ПСПОС и увеличената достъпност на АРВ, смъртността, причинена от СПИН, започна да спада в субсахарска Африка през 2005 г. През последните 10 години броят на новите ХИВ инфекции спадна с повече от 25 процента в 22 страни от района, включително и тези с най-много заразени хора.СПИН в черна АмерикаДокато броят на новите ХИВ инфекции спадна значително в субсахарска Африка, той се промени твърде малко в Съединените щати, особено в афро-американските общности. Въпреки че черните американци представляват едва 13 процента от населението на САЩ, те представляват почти 50 процента от американците, живеещи с ХИВ/СПИН и 40 процента от смъртните случаи до днес. Изчисленият жизнен риск за зараза с ХИВ е 1 на 16 за черните мъже, 1 на 30 за черните жени, 1 на 104 за белите мъже и 1 на 588 за белите жени.Фил Уилсън, основател и изпълнителен директор на Черния СПИН институт, посочва, че ако черна Америка беше държава, щеше да се нареди 16-та в света по ХИВ инфекции. Във Вашингтон, където три четвърти от инфектираните са черни и нивото на инфекции се удвои при черните жени между 2008 и 2010 г., нивото на разпространение на ХИВ е с почти 3 процента над нивото в Демократична република Конго, Гана, Гвинея, Либерия и още няколко субсахарски страни.Програмата \"Схема за формацевтични ползи\" (СФП)Край на играта - СПИН в черна Америка. Грегорио Милет, старши политически съветник на Службата по национална СПИН политика, казва \"ние не направихме нищо, ние прекарахме 30 години в напълно некоординирана реакция срещу ХИВ. Въпреки че изисквахме от страните, които финансирахме, да имат национална ХИВ/СПИН стратегия, САЩ никога не е имала собствена национална ХИВ/СПИН стратегия.\"Целта на ПСПОС беше да сподели със света най-добрите практики, установени в Съединените щати, по време на първите 20 години на ХИВ/СПИН епидемията. Макар ПСПОС да приближава края на своето първо десетилетие, програмата може сега да вземе обрат - да приложи най-добрите практики от чужбина в Съединените щати, особено при бедното черно население.Конкретните примери доказват това. Въпреки декларацията на Нациос, проучванията в субсахарска Африка показват нива на придържане към АРВ, по-високи от 90 процента, докато придържането към ХИВ медикаментите в Съединените щати е едва 60-70 процента. Африканският успех изглежда се дължи на няколко фактора, сред които прилагането на ефективно взаимно консултиране и на системи, които са обществено насочени, вместо да са индивидуално ориентирани. ПСПОС подходът, макар и не перфектен, ясно показва, че подобен подход би бил благотворен в засегнатите от бедност градове като Вашингтон, щат Колумбия.ПСПОС предлага преместване на отговорността за ХИВ тестването и консултирането от претоварените доставчици на здравни услуги към обществеността и здравните работници. В ПСПОС програмите широката достъпност до консултиране на пациентите чрез обществените здравни мрежи и силната семейна подкрепа са в основата на придържането към медикаментите. Консултирането е осигурено в общността на няколко нива от здравната мрежа, включително сестри, фармацевти и други доставчици, като отделните хора са свързани към парньорска мрежа за подкрепа на други хора, живеещи с ХИВ/СПИН.В Съединените щати ХИВ инфекцията често се разглежда само от медицинска гледна точка, но ПСПОС показа, че социалната подкрепа е важна част от оказването на грижи на хора, живеещи със заразата. Например, бедното население в градските зони трябва да се бори с проблеми като липсата на дом и наркоманията, които усложняват придържането към лечението.Далечна Африка може да има малко значение за Съединените щати, но сега \"тъмният континент\" хвърля светлина по пътя за спасяване от най-лошата епидемия в историята.\n\t\t\t",

اثنتين من المعاهدات الدولية الرائدة، هما اتفاقيتا مونتريال وكيوتو، فشلا بما يكفي للحد من استخدام المواد الكيميائية واستنفاد الأوزون المسببة لظاهرة الاحتباس الحراري.إن استنفاد الأوزون والاحتباس الحراري كلاهما من صنع الإنسان ومترابطان، وهما يشكلان أخطر الأزمات البيئية من أي وقت مضى.ينفق الناس في الولايات المتحدة الآن ما يزيد على 3 مليارات دولار سنويا لتصحيح حالات إعتام عدسة العين التي يمكن أن تنجم عن التعرض للأشعة فوق البنفسجية ب ((UV-B. وتنفق على صناعة التأمين عشرات المليارات من الدولارات لمساعدة الناس الذين تعطلت حياتهم بسبب الظواهر الجوية غير العادية الناتجة عن تغير المناخ العالمي. ينبغي أن تشجع هذه الحقائق وحدها المفاوضين للبيئة في الولايات المتحدة على اتخاذ إجراءات تكفل الحد والقضاء على إنتاج واستعمال وانبعاثات المواد الكيميائية فيما يتعلق بكل من استنفاد الأوزون و الاحتباس الحراري في أقرب وقت ممكن من الناحية التكنولوجية.يؤدي اعتماد الصناعة على المدى الطويل على مركبات الكربون الكلورية فلورية (CFCs)، ومركبات الكربون الهيدروكلورية فلورية (HCFCs)، وبروميد الميثيل، والمواد الكيميائية الأخرى إلى أزمة في الغلاف الجوي العالمي لا يمكن تجاهلها. عادة، تمنع طبقة الأوزون تقريبا كل الأشعة فوق البنفسجية UV-B، والتي تلعب دورا هاما في تكوين سرطان الجلد، وإعتام عدسة العين، ونقص جهاز المناعة، وأمراض صحية أخرى. إن فقدان 1٪ من الأوزون في طبقة الستراتوسفير يعادل زيادة بنسبة 2٪ في سرطانات الجلد وزيادة بنسبة 1٪ تقريبا في حالات إعتام عدسة العين في جميع أنحاء العالم. وهذه ليست سوى بضعة من الأسباب التي جعلت قادة العالم يصوغون بروتوكول مونتريال لعام 1987 بشأن المواد المستنفدة لطبقة الأوزون، ويهدف هذا البروتوكول إلى القضاء بسرعة على استخدام مركبات الكربون الكلورية فلورية ومواد كيميائية أخرى مستنفدة للأوزون.لم ينجح بروتوكول مونتريال، للأسف، في وقف تدهور طبقة الأوزون بالرغم من أنه صادق عليه 172 دولة وأشاد به العديد من الخبراء كأنجح اتفاقية بيئية دولية. في عامي 1998 و 1999، تم العثور على ثقب الأوزون في القطب الجنوبي ليكون الأكبر، والأعمق، والأطول دائما من أي وقت مضى. وقد تم الإبلاغ عن زيادة الأشعة فوق البنفسجية UV-B على مستوى سطح الأرض في أجزاء كثيرة من العالم، بما في ذلك نيوزيلندا وكندا.علاوة على ذلك، في أواخر عام 1997 ثم مرة أخرى في أواخر عام 1999، ذكرت وكالة الفضاء الأوروبية أدلة على وجود ثقب الأوزون فوق بريطانيا وبلجيكا، وهولندا، والدول الاسكندينافية. وكانت هذه الأحداث نتيجة لانخفاض درجات الحرارة بشكل غير عادي في طبقة الستراتوسفير، وزيادة معدل استنفاد الأوزون الناجمة عن المواد الكيميائية المستهلكة للأوزون. وبناء على ذلك، يبدو أن فقدان الأوزون قد يكون أكثر حدة مما توقعه العلماء في البداية. وقد حفز هذا الخبر الجماعة الأوروبية لتصبح من الدعاة الأكثر صخبا لاتخاذ مزيدا من الإجراءات لحماية طبقة الأوزون.وهناك أيضا أدلة على أن استنفاد الأوزون هو إخفاء لظاهرة الاحتباس الحراري، لأن استنفاد الأوزون يبرد طبقة الستراتوسفير حتى ولو كانت درجة حرارة سطح الأرض أعلى من المعدلات التاريخية. ومن المتوقع أن تتسبب ظاهرة الاحتباس الحراري في ارتفاع مستويات المحيطات، وفي انخفاض إنتاجية النباتات، وفي أنماط طقس أكثر تواترا وخطورة. قد يصعّب أيضا استنفاد الأوزون مكافحة ظاهرة الاحتباس الحراري، وذلك لأن أكثر أضواء الأشعة فوق البنفسجية تخترق محيطات العالم وتدمر العوالق. حيث تلعب العوالق دورا محوريا في قدرة المحيطات على استخلاص ثاني أكسيد الكربون (المادة الكيميائية الأولية لظاهرة الاحتباس الحراري) من الغلاف الجوي، مما يجعل المحيطات (إلى جانب الغابات المطيرة) \"مصارف للكربون\" ذات أهمية. ويزيد فقدان هذه \"المصارف\" من تفاقم ظاهرة الاحتباس الحراري عن طريق تسريع تراكم ما يسمى بالغازات الدفيئة في الغلاف الجوي.تسعى مجموعتان من الاتفاقات الدولية إلى معالجة هذه الأزمات: اتفاقية فيينا وهي بروتوكول مونتريال لعام 1987 الذي يتعلق بنضوب الأوزون، وبالنسبة لظاهرة الاحتباس الحراري، فهناك الاتفاقية الإطارية بشأن تغير المناخ وهي بروتوكول كيوتو لعام 1997، التي تمثل معاهدة معقدة للغاية وقعتها أكثر من 175 بلدا. على الرغم من أن بروتوكول مونتريال يقوم بالتخلص التدريجي من أسوأ المواد المستنفدة للأوزون (مركبات الكربون الكلورية فلورية(CFCs)، ومركبات الكربون الهيدروكلورية فلورية(HCFCs)، والهالونات، وبروميد الميثيل)، إلا أنه للأسف يسمح باستبدال المواد الكيميائية المستنفدة للأوزون مع اثنين من الغازات الدفيئة، هي مركبات الكربون الهيدروفلورية  (HFCs)ومركبات الكربون المشبعة بالفلور(PFCs). و كل هذه المواد الكيميائية هي من بين الغازات الستة لظاهرة الاحتباس الحراري التي يمكن التحكم بها بموجب بروتوكول كيوتو.تحتوي بروتوكولات مونتريال وكيوتو على آليات لاستعراض المعارف العلمية، وتنقيح التواريخ المحددة للمراقبة، ومنع المزيد من المواد الكيميائية. وقد أدت عمليات التقييم العلمي لبروتوكول مونتريال (1989، 1991، 1994، و 1998)، على سبيل المثال، إلى اعتماد ثلاثة تعديلات لإنشاء جداول زمنية للاستغناء التدريجي عن بروميد الميثيل، ومركبات الكربون الهيدروكلورية فلورية(HCFCs)، ومواد كيميائية أخرى مستنفدة للأوزون. على الرغم من عدم تعديل بروتوكول كيوتو الأحدث من ذلك بكثير، حتى الآن، إلا أن لديه آلية مماثلة تتطلب مراجعة علمية لأحكامها.وفي الوقت الذي ندخل فيه الألفية الجديدة، هناك أدلة علمية دامغة على أن الاحتباس الحراري واستنفاد طبقة الأوزون هما من أشد الأزمات البيئية خطورة التي واجهتها البشرية. فنظراً لأنها مترابطة فيما بينها، هناك حاجة ملحة لاستراتيجيات جديدة  التي ستكافحها في وقت واحد.مشاكل مع سياسة الولايات المتحدة الحاليةالمشاكل الرئيسية تعمل وكالات الولايات المتحدة المسؤولة عن تنفيذ بروتوكول مونتريال في تناقض، مما يؤدي إلى ضعف الجهود المبذولة لحماية طبقة الأوزون.فشلت واشنطن في دعم الجهود الرامية إلى تسريع التخلص التدريجي من مركبات الكربون الهيدروكلورية فلورية (HCFC)لم تدعم الولايات المتحدة بما فيه الكفاية اعتماد بدائل للمواد المسببة في استنفاد الأوزون وتغير المناخ مثل مركبات الكربون الهيدروكلورية فلورية (HCFCs).إن معالجة الولايات المتحدة لبروتوكولات مونتريال وكيوتو، كونها معاهدات بيئية تستبعد بعضها بعضا، لم تفشل فقط في استيعاب الأدلة العلمية الجديدة التي تثبت الارتباط بين نضوب الأوزون وظاهرة الاحتباس الحراري ولكنها تؤدي أيضا إلى إقرار سياسات غير فعالة ومتنافرة التي لا توفر حماية كافية للحياة على الأرض ضد تلك التهديدات التفاعلية للغلاف الجوي. وبالإضافة إلى ذلك، فقد رعيَت إدارة كلينتون مصالح قطاع الصناعة عازمة على إطالة فترة استخدام المواد الكيميائية المسببة لنضوب الأوزون وظاهرة الاحتباس الحراري. وعلى سبيل المثال، رفضت واشنطن تسريع الاستغناء التدريجي على مركبات الكربون الهيدروكلورية فلورية(HCFC) أو سد الثغرة التي تسمح باستخدام بروميد الميثيل(MB) في البلدان النامية حتى بعد عام 2005، عندما تنتهي تدريجيا في البلدان المتقدمة.في عام 1992، سمح بروتوكول مونتريال باستمرار استخدام البروميد الميثيل(MB) – مبيد قاتل فضلا عن أنه مستنزف فعال للأوزون – لتبخير البضائع وحاويات الشحن المستخدمة في التجارة الدولية والمحلية. ويمثل هذا الاستخدام حاليا أكثر من 22٪ من البروميد الميثيل(MB) المستهلكة في جميع أنحاء العالم. و تنقسم وكالات الولايات المتحدة بشأن مسألة البروميد الميثيل(MB). وتحت إلحاح من جماعات الضغط الصناعية، وسعت وزارة الزراعة الأمريكية (USDA) تطبيق البروميد الميثيل(MB) لتشمل منتجات الأخشاب المستخدمة في الملاحة الدولية من الصين والمكسيك، على الرغم من أن كلا البلدين قد أشارا إلى أن المعالجة الحرارية هي أقل تكلفة وأقل ضررا للبيئة على حد سواء. في أغسطس 1999، ذكرت أيضا مذكرة وكالة حماية البيئة (EPA) أن الوكالة \"لا يمكن إيجاد مبرر\" لمستوردي الخشب في استخدام البروميد الميثيل(MB).كان يتعارض إقرار السياسات في الولايات المتحدة بطرق أخرى أيضا. ويعفي بروتوكول مونتريال مؤقتا إنتاج واستخدام مركبات الكربون الكلورية فلورية(CFCs) لأغراض طبية. وقد اتخذت عدة دول أوروبية والبعض من الدول النامية إجراءات، إدراكا منها بالموازنة بين الاحتياجات الطبية مع الاحتياجات البيئية، والابتعاد عن أجهزة الاستنشاق بالجرعات المقننة(MDIs) التي تحتوي على مركبات الكربون الكلورية فلورية(CFCs). وتتفق وكالة حماية البيئة(EPA) مع هذا الموقف. ومع ذلك، في سبتمبر 1999، ذكرت إدارة الغذاء والدواء(FDA) أنها لن تنهي الموافقات على أجهزة الاستنشاق بالجرعات المقننة(MDIs) بمركبات الكربون الكلورية فلورية(CFC) الجديدة، حتى ولو تم الموافقة على إحدى أجهزة الاستنشاق بالجرعات المقننة(MDIs) دون مركبات الكربون الكلورية فلورية(CFC) وهناك المزيد في الطريق. وفي اجتماع عام 1999 لبروتوكول مونتريال في بكين، ساهمت الولايات المتحدة في عرقلة اقتراح مقدم من كوستاريكا التي كانت تسيطر على مواصلة هذه الاستخدامات كما سهلت انتقالا أكثر فعالية من أجهزة الاستنشاق بالجرعات المقننة (MDIs) بمركبات الكربون الكلورية فلورية(CFC) إلى أساليب التسليم بالطب البديل.بموجب بروتوكول مونتريال، لن يتم التخلص من مركبات الكربون الهيدروكلورية فلورية(HCFCs) إلى غاية عام 2030. وقد دعت المفوضية الأوروبية (EC) والعديد من المنظمات غير الحكومية إلى تسريع التخلص التدريجي من مركبات الكربون الهيدروكلورية فلورية(HCFCs). ومع ذلك، لم تدعم الولايات المتحدة هذه الجهود، في المقام الأول لأن دوبونت وغيرها من الشركات الأمريكية قد أنفقت مليارات الدولارات على تطوير مركبات الكربون الهيدروكلورية فلورية (HCFCs) كبدائل لمركبات الكربون الكلورية فلورية (CFCs). وفقط في عام 1999 وافقت إدارة كلينتون أخيرا على ضوابط جديدة بشأن إنتاج مركبات الكربون الهيدروكلورية فلورية (HCFCs)، ولكنها فشلت رغم ذلك في التسريع في جدول التخلص التدريجي من الاستهلاك. وعلى الرغم من أن الاتفاق يشير إلى إحراز تقدم في مجال صنع السياسات الأمريكية، إلا أن موقف واشنطن بشأن التخلص التدريجي من مركبات الكربون الهيدروكلورية فلورية (HCFC) لا يزال غير واضح.إضافة إلى مخاطر بطء التخلص التدريجي من مركبات الكربون الهيدروكلورية فلورية (HCFC)، فإن استخدام المواد الكيميائية الأخرى القائمة على المواد الكربونية الفلورية – مركبات الكربون الهيدروفلورية (HFCs) ومركبات الكربون المشبعة بالفلور (PFCs) – هو أيضا مسموح. إن هذه المواد الكيميائية هي من بين الغازات الستة المخصصة للمراقبة بموجب اتفاقية تغير المناخ العالمي. وقد أدى هذا التناقض إلى الالتباس حول أفضل بديل للاعتماد في كل من البلدان المتقدمة و البلدان النامية. إن الفشل في مراقبة مركبات الكربون الهيدروفلورية (HFCs) ومركبات الكربون المشبعة بالفلور (PFCs) يقلل كذلك من الحافز للصناعة نحو إتباع بدائل للمواد المسببة في نضوب الأوزون وظاهرة الاحتباس الحراري.تواصل صناعة الفلوروكربون، ممثلة في التحالف من أجل سياسة مسؤولة في مجال الغلاف الجوي، في تعزيز بقوة مركبات الكربون الهيدروفلورية(HFCs) ومركبات الكربون الهيدروكلورية فلورية(HCFCs) لاستخدامها في البلدان النامية. ويستهدف تحالف جماعات الضغط في الاجتماعات السنوية الدولية للأوزون البلدان النامية، بحجة أن هذه المواد الكيميائية لا يمكن التخلص منها تدريجيا بسبب أن البدائل المجدية تجاريا غير متوفرة. وفي الواقع، هناك الآن عدد قليل فقط من الحالات التي لا تتوفر فيها بدائل، وفي بعض هذه الحالات، يسمح البروتوكول للشركات أن تطلب الإذن لاستخدام هذه المواد الكيميائية بموجب أحكام الطوارئ.حتى الآن، لم تدعم الولايات المتحدة بشكل كاف اعتماد البدائل غير المستنفدة للأوزون على المستوى الدولي ولم تعزز بما فيه الكفاية انخفاض الاحتباس الحراري والتكنولوجيات دون مركبات الكربون الهيدروكلورية فلورية(HCFC) في إطار برنامجها الخاص بسياسة بدائل مركبات الكربون الكلورية فلورية(CFC) التي تسمى سياسة البدائل الهامة الجديدة (SNAP). أنشأت وكالة حماية البيئة(EPA) سياسة البدائل الهامة الجديدة(SNAP) لتسهيل اعتماد بدائل لمركبات الكربون الكلورية فلورية(CFCs) والهالونات، وتتمثل مهمة الوكالة في نشر قوائم البدائل المقبولة وغير المقبولة. ولتحديد ما هو مقبول، تعتمد الوكالة على المعلومات المقدمة من قبل العلماء الموظفين، والخبراء الاستشاريين، ومستشاري العلوم، والعامة، والشركات. في الممارسة العملية، أوصت وكالة حماية البيئة(EPA) في كثير من الأحيان على مقترح الصناعة باستبدال مركبات الكربون الهيدروكلورية فلورية(HCFCs) ومركبات الكربون الهيدروفلورية(HFCs) لمركبات الكربون الكلورية فلورية (CFCs) في التبريد، وتكييف الهواء، وقطاعات الرغاوي العازلة، حتى عندما يكون الأوزون غير مستنفد، وبدائل الاحتباس الحراري غير متوفرة.نحو سياسة خارجية جديدةالتوصيات الرئيسيةيتعين على الولايات المتحدة ربط الناحية القانونية للاتفاقين لضمان أن تنفيذ بروتوكول مونتريال لا يقوض بروتوكول كيوتو.يتعين على الولايات المتحدة العمل على التخلص التدريجي من مركبات الكربون الهيدروكلورية فلورية (HCFCs) بحلول عام 2004.يتعين على الولايات المتحدة زيادة مبلغ التمويل الذي تقدمه للصندوق المتعدد الأطراف عن طريق تعيين جزء من ضريبة على وجود المادة الكيميائية المستنفدة للأوزون لصالح الصندوق.إن حماية طبقة الأوزون واحدة من القضايا البيئية الأكثر سخونة خلال السباق الرئاسي في عام 1992. ففي ضوء الأدلة العلمية الجديدة التي تبين أوجه التفاعل السلبي بين تغير المناخ العالمي واستنفاد الأوزون، ينبغي أن تلعب هذه الأزمات المزدوجة دوراً رئيسيا في المواقف البيئية للمرشحين في الحملات لعام 2000.سوف يكون الرئيس المقبل في وضع فريد لتغيير السياسات القائمة لجعلها أكثر اتساقا مع الحاجة الواضحة لوقف الضرر المتصاعد إلى الغلاف الجوي للأرض. وبغض النظر عن تكوين المؤتمر المقبل، فلدى الرئيس السلطة التنفيذية على سن عدد من الإصلاحات اللازمة. على سبيل المثال، يمكن للرئيس الجديد أن يطلب من وكالة حماية البيئة (EPA) ووزارة الزراعة الأميركية (USDA) فرض حظر على جميع استخدامات بروميد الميثيل في مجال النقل البحري، إلا في حالات الطوارئ. وعلاوة على ذلك، يمكن للرئيس تمييز نفسه من خلال الالتزام بالعمل مع الكونغرس لزيادة حصة التمويل التي تساهم بها الولايات المتحدة في الصندوق متعدد الأطراف. ويمكن لمثل هذه القيادة أن تشجع البلدان الأخرى على اتخاذ إجراءات مماثلة.تحتاج الولايات المتحدة للتأكد من أن أهداف بروتوكول مونتريال لا تقوض بروتوكول كيوتو. للقيام بذلك، ينبغي عليها أن تدعم الصلة القانونية بين البروتوكولين وينبغي حظر اعتماد مركبات الكربون الهيدروكلورية فلورية (HCFCs)، ومركبات الكربون الهيدروفلورية (HFCs)، وغيرها من المواد الكيميائية للاحتباس الحراري كبدائل للمواد الكيميائية المستنفدة للأوزون،  ما لم يكن هناك بديل آخر مجدي من الناحية التكنولوجية.يرتبط بروتوكول مونتريال بالفعل مع اتفاقية بازل بشأن النقل الدولي للنفايات الخطرة. وفي عام 1995، وافقت الأطراف في اتفاقية بازل على حظر التجارة في المواد المستنفدة للأوزون الخاضعة لبروتوكول مونتريال. وينبغي على الأطراف في بروتوكول مونتريال اتخاذ قرار مماثل لضمان أن التكنولوجيات التي اعتمدت كبدائل للمواد المستنفدة للأوزون لا تقوض أهداف بروتوكول كيوتو.إن جدول التخلص التدريجي الحالي التابع لبروتوكول مونتريال والمتعلق بمركبات الكربون الهيدروكلورية فلورية (HCFCs) لعام 2030، بعيد جدا لكبح أي من دمار طبقة الأوزون أو الاحتباس الحراري. وسيجبر التخلص التدريجي المعجل الصناعة الكيميائية على الابتكار كما فعلت عندما وضعت مركبات الكربون الهيدروكلورية فلورية (HCFCs) كبديل لمركبات الكربون الكلورية فلورية (CFCs).ينبغي إلغاء مركبات الكربون الهيدروكلورية فلورية (HCFCs) في موعد لا يتجاوز عام 2004. وفقا للتقييم العلمي لسنة 1998، فإن القضاء على إنتاج مركبات الكربون الهيدروكلورية فلورية(HCFCs) هو ثالث أهم إجراء يمكن للأطراف أن تتخذه لتسريع استعادة طبقة الأوزون. (على افتراض الامتثال التام لجميع متطلبات التخلص التدريجي حتى الآن، فإن أولى وثاني الإجراءات الأكثر أهمية هي التخلص من انبعاثات كل من هالون-1211 وهالون-1301 في جميع أنحاء العالم بحلول نهاية هذا العام). وقد يبعث التخلص التدريجي من مركبات الكربون الهيدروكلورية فلورية(HCFCs) لعام 2004 أيضا  إشارة واضحة إلى البلدان النامية على عدم استخدام التكنولوجيات المؤقتة عند التماس البدائل لمركبات الكربون الكلورية فلورية (CFC). بدلا من ذلك، يجب اعتماد حلولا طويلة الأمد التي تحمي طبقة الأوزون وتخفف الاحتباس الحراري. إن التخلص التدريجي الموجود لسنة 2030، لم يفعل سوى القليل من أجل توجيه الصناعة نحو الاستثمارات اللازمة في البحث والتطوير لجعل البدائل الموجودة، غير القائمة على الفلوروكربونية، معقولة أكثر.وبالإضافة إلى ذلك، ينبغي على وكالة حماية البيئة (EPA )، كجزء من سياسة البدائل الهامة الجديدة (SNAP)، دعم ظهور البدائل غير المستنفدة للأوزون في الولايات المتحدة، مثل تقنيات نفخ الرغاوي المائية والمبردات الهيدروكربونية والآمونية. كما ينبغي أيضا على وكالة حماية البيئة أن توفر المنح الصغيرة للشركات الراغبة في اعتماد التكنولوجيا الأكثر ملاءمة وأن تتتبع أداء المنتج الجديد لإبلاغ السياسات المستقبلية والمواقف التفاوضية. وبما أن واشنطن اكتسبت مزيدا من الخبرة مع هذه البدائل، فستكون في وضع أفضل لمناصرة هذه البدائل على الصعيد الدولي.تستطيع الولايات المتحدة أيضا زيادة التزاماتها المالية للصندوق متعدد الأطراف، الذي يساعد البلدان النامية على إيجاد بدائل غير تدميرية. وتوفر الولايات المتحدة حاليا حوالي 24٪ من الميزانية الإجمالية للصندوق. وعلى الرغم من أن هذه هي أكبر حصة أسهِم بها من أي بلد، إلا أنها منصِفة، نظرا لأن شركات الولايات المتحدة تصنّع معظم المواد الكيميائية المستنفدة للأوزون. وتستطيع الولايات المتحدة زيادة حصتها في الصندوق من خلال تخصيص جزء من الضرائب على المادة الكيميائية المستنفدة للأوزون. وبالإضافة إلى ذلك، يجب على واشنطن حث الدول الأخرى على سداد التزاماتها في الوقت المحدد وبالكامل. التزمت اليابان، على سبيل المثال، بدفع أقل بقليل من 20٪ ولكن لم تدفع هذا المبلغ كاملا. وفشلت إيطاليا وألمانيا ودول أخرى أيضا على الوفاء بالتزاماتها.بدلا من النظر إلى الوراء في التخلص التدريجي الناجح من مركبات الكربون الكلورية فلورية (CFC)، تحتاج الولايات المتحدة إلى التطلع نحو المستقبل والعمل على التخلص بسرعة من جميع المواد المستنفدة للأوزون دون المساس بأهداف المعاهدات الأخرى. إن هذه الأزمة العالمية في الغلاف الجوي هي من صنع الإنسان وليست مستعصية عن الحل. يمكن للولايات المتحدة، من خلال الجمع بين المعرفة العلمية، والابتكار الصناعي، والإرادة السياسية، والسياسات العامة السليمة، المساعدة في حماية طبقة الأوزون دون إضافة لظاهرة الاحتباس الحراري.\n\t\t\t",

I opened the first letter, then the second, by the third letter I must have gotten distracted and ripped the envelope to quickly. That's when I felt the edge of the paper rip into my finger. Automatically, I reacted and dropped the letter on the table and saw the slit on my finger in which it started to bleed. I headed to the bathroom and in the medicine cabinet I pulled out the first aid kit. I rinsed my finger under warm water and disinfected it with alcohol. Then I patted dry my finger and opened an medium sized band aid to place it on my finger. I peeled the backing on the band aid and place it over the small cut on my finger.

        "document_str": "\nЛатинска Америка: люшкащите се държави на климатичната промянаСпециалният пратеник на САЩ по климатичната промяна Тод Стърн пътува заедно с помощник-секретаря на Държавното бюро за състоянието в западното полукълбо - Артуро Валенцуела, до Чили, Перу и Еквадор миналата седмица, за да обсъди климатичната промяна с колегите си от правителството и с гражданите. В официалната програма присъстваха следните точки: задълбочаване на двустранното и многостранното сътрудничество за увеличаване на икономическия растеж, намаляване на парниковите газове и подпомагане на населението в климатично чувствителните зони. Но политическата цел на пътуването беше прокарването на Копенхагенското споразумение - противоречив договор, който Съединените щати представиха на обсъждането на климата през 2009 г. в ООН и който беше блокиран от няколко страни в Латинска Америка - преди срещата за климата в Мексико в края на 2010 г.  Южноамериканската обиколка на Стърн - само три седмици преди следващата среща за Рамковата конвенция на ООН по климатичната промяна(UNFCCC) в Бон - показва нарастващата важност на ролята на народите от Латинска Америка в постигането на съгласие за климата. Неговото посещение разкри как Съединените щати използват дебата за климата като част от по-голяма политика за постигане на политическо влияние, търговия и достъп до ресурси в полукълбото.Издигащата се Латинска АмерикаБогатите страни (Анекс 1 от UNFCCC) отдавна са център на преговорите за климатичната промяна. Тези държави заедно подсигуряват своята власт, като тестват зоните на раздор, които вече съществуват между развиващите се страни - често противопоставяйки най-обеднелите нации на изграждащите се икономики. Страните от Анекс 1 непрекъснато прехвърлят вината за провалените преговори върху развиващите се страни, често обвинявайки Китай, Филипините или всяка страна, която отказва да приеме уговорки, които ще подкопаят из основи икономическите и екологическите интереси на развиващите се страни.Развиващите се страни от Г77 и Китай (блок за преговори, който представлява повече от 130 нации) напоследък се опитват да приложат съвместни усилия относно преговорите за климата, особено около правата за развитие. Китай и Индия, като големи източници на парникови газове, се считат за влиятелни участници, защото всеки план за намаляване на емисиите без тяхно участие няма да доведе на спиране на климатичния хаос. Малките островни и африкански нации държат моралната власт, защото климатичната промяна ще бъде най-опустошителна за техните народи. Междувременно Латинска Америка никога не е била в центъра на дебата за климата - досега.Тази година преговорите за глобалния климат ще се проведат в Канкун, Мексико. Мексиканското правителство е под силен натиск да избегне фиаското от Копенхаген. Тогава датските домакини затънаха в процедурен катаклизъм, като оставиха делегатите да студуват извън залата на срещата, докато вътре не избухнаха демонстрации. В крайна сметка не успяха да накарат участващите страни да се спрат на разумно решение.Мексиканското правителство е решено да постигне значителен прогрес по поне два ключови елемента - финансиране за климата и използване на въглеродните пазари за намаляване на емисиите от обезлесяването и горската ерозия (REDD). В същото време то внушава, че възможностите за постигане на споразумение за глобалния климат не са обещаващи. Кристина Фигерес, ветеранка от 15 г. в екипа за преговори на Коста Рика, провъзгласена за новия секретар на РКОНКП, ще отговаря за осигуряването на успешни преговори.Бразилия, най-голямата от деветте страни в амазонския басейн, иззе лидерството на REDD в Америките. С милионите си хектари земя и потенциални трилиони долари, заложени на карта, без да броим правата на коренните народи и държавния суверенитет, Бразилия е наистина ключов участник.В допълнение, Боливия заедно с Еквадор, Никарагуа и Венецуела се обявиха за бастион на климатичната справедливост. Разгневена от странния процес, който доведе до Копенхагенското споразумение, Боливия свика среща на своя глава, като покани всички провителства и граждански общества на Конференция на световните народи по климатичната промяна и правата на майката земя в Кочабамба през април. Последицата от това глобално събиране беше Народното споразумение, което Боливия официално връчи на РКОНКП от името на глобалното гражданско общество. Разочароващо е, че официалните текстове не отразяват нищо от това споразумение. Боливия обаче успя да обърне достатъчно внимание на съдържанието му, което включва уважение към правата на коренните жители, отхвърляне на компенсирането на въглерода, незабавно и рязко намаляване на парниковите газове в индустриализираните страни и мащабно прехвърляне на финансови средства от развитите към развиващите се страни.Планът на САЩСъединените щати ясно изразиха плановете си за международните преговори за климата в стратегически комуникационни цели, случайно изтекли през април. В началото на списъка е \"засилване на чувството, че САЩ участват активно в преговорите на ООН, целящи да постигнат глобален режим за борба с климатичната промяна\". Документът заставя преговарящия екип на САЩ да \"създаде ясно разбиране за Копенхагенското споразумение и за важността на операционализирането на ВСИЧКИ елементи\".Копенхагенското споразумение обхваща всички основни политически нужди на Съединените щати. Обвързващите обещания за намаляване на емисиите на парникови газове бяха редуцирани до доброволни \"обещай и преразгледай\" процеси. Обещанията, направени досега, не постигнаха 25-40% намаления в богатите страни, за които учените от Междуправителствения панел по климатичната промяна казаха, че са необходими за избягването на климатична катастрофа. Неизпълнението на тези цели не носи никакви законови последици.Липсва също и разграничаването между страните, които, исторически погледнато, са освобождавали голямо количество парникови газове, и тези, които наскоро са се присъединили към редовете на най-големите източници на разпространение. Копенхагенското споразумение изисква всички развиващи се страни, с изключение на малките островни нации и най-малко развитите страни, да прилагат действия за ограничаване на парниковите газове. На практика споразумението предвижда повече прозрачност и отчетност за тези страни, отколкото за богатите страни.Развиващите се страни предсказуемо се противопоставиха на идеята, че те трябва да предприемат обвързващи съкращения на емисиите, преди това да направят най-богатите и най-големите източници на разпространение на планетата. Също така, те отбелязват, че последиците от симетричните съкращения са много различни за хората, живеещи в по-богатите и по-бедните страни. Например 20 % съкращения в САЩ ще означава средно намаление до 16 тона въглерод на човек за година. Същото съкращение в Индия ще доведе средните въглеродни емисии от 1,6 тона до 1,3 тона на година. С други думи, дори скромно съкращение в богатите страни няма да промени значително качеството на живот на хората, но ще осъди на бедност развиващите се страни.Копенхагенското споразумение възхвалява пазарните стимули за довеждането на търговията с REDD и горски въглерод в интернет. REDD е важно за обещанието на САЩ да съкрати нивата на емисиите от 2005 г. със 17 % до 2020 г. Закупуването на горски въглерод чрез кредити е по-евтино, по-бързо и лесно от почистването на замърсяващите фабрики и енергийните централи. Вместо да намалят емисиите в Съединените щати, замърсителите ще плащат на горските страни да не изсичат дърветата си, купувайки въглерода в дърветата, за да балансират продължаващото освобождаване на парникови газове у дома. Но компенсациите като цяло и горските компенсации в частност са обект на съпротива от страна на учени по климата, финансисти и местни общности, защото те са трудни за проверяване и въздействат върху традиционните употреби на горите и правата върху тях.Освен това, споразумението очертава параметрите на финансите за климата. То обещава, че развитите страни ще предоставят най-много 30 милиарда долара до 2012 г. и 100 милиарда долара до 2020 г. на развиващите се страни да се приспособят към климатичната промяна и да продължат по нисковъглеродни пътища за развитие.Страни като Боливия и Еквадор твърдят, че богатите страни дължат на развиващия се свят \"климатичен дълг\". Страните от Анекс 1 трябва да изплатят този дълг, отчасти като намалят драстично емисиите, за да позволят на хората от страните извън Анекс 1 да използват полагащото им се от атмосферата на планетата. Поради просрочените плащания на индустриализирания свят, защитниците на климатичната справедливост вярват, че няма място за компенсиране на въглеродни емисии чрез закупуването на въглеродни кредити. Вместо това, те настояват богатите страни да покрият разходите на общностите за приспособяването им към затоплящия се свят и да възстановят ангажиментите, заложени в РКОНКП за предоставяне на подкрепа за преминаването към нисковъглеродно развитие. Стоте милиарда долара, предвидени от споразумението според данните на ПРОН, РКОНКП и Световната банка, са напълно недостатъчни за посрещането на тези нужди.В първите си две спирки в Чили и Перу миналата седмица Стърн недиректно смъмри противниците на Копенхагенското споразумение, като каза, че \"отстояването на позиции, които другите няма да приемат, няма да придвижи нещата напред\". Все пак, когато Съединените щати отстояват позиции, които противоречат на интересите на развиващите се страни, се очаква по-слабите страни да окажат подкрепа или да изпаднат в немилост.За да добави тежест на предупреждението, че страните не могат да подбират частите от споразумението, които харесват, Съединените щати отрязаха 3 милиона долара финансиране за климата на Боливия и 2,5 милиона - на Еквадор. Стърн обяви, че финансирането е \"договорено като част от Копенхагенското споразумение и, като общо правило, Съединените щати ще предоставят средствата на страни, които са показали интерес да бъдат част от споразумението\".Новата \"парадигма за климатична дипломация\" на САЩ, представена от преговарящите по климата през юни, изглежда ще включва изнудване на развиващите се страни, които отчаяно се нуждаят от подкрепа, за да се справят с последиците от криза, която не са създали.Стърн отива на югВ изтеклите стратегически комуникационни цели съществува предложение да \"се обмисли серия политически речи и обществени форуми по време на пътувания в чужбина, за да се представи нашата кауза директно пред развиващия се свят\", подсказа Тод Стърн.Първата спирка от обиколката на Стърн беше Чили - страна, коята заедно с Колумбия се опита да убеди Боливия и другите развиващи се страни да подкрепят споразумението. В обръщението си пред студенти и преподаватели, събрани в Чилийския университет по икономика и бизнес, Стърн поздрави Чили за подкрепата на Копенхагенското споразумение. Той подчерта нуждата от по-голяма регионална координация и призова Америките да инсталират повече зелена енергия, за да \"разширят кръга на просперитет в цялото ни полукълбо, а също да намалят нашите въглеродни емисии\".Това, което Стърн не спомена, е, че Чили, като един от глобалните лидери във водното елекричество, генерира милиони въглеродни кредити, които развитите страни ще искат, ако се приемат ангажименти за намаляване на емисиите в Канкун следващата година. Съединените щати вече установиха близки икономически връзки с Чили чрез споразумение за свободна търговия, което двете страни подписаха през 2004 г., а и са задействани планове за пълно либерализиране на търговията през 2016 г. Енергийните и излишните въглеродни кредити може да се окажат двете стоки, които Съединените щати ще пазаруват дотогава.Перу - страна, която има споразумение за свободна търговия със Съединените щати от началото на 2009 г., може също да бъде важен източник на евтини въглеродни кредити, по същия начин, по който сега доставя готови минерали и метали на корпорациите на север. Според Хосе Алберто Гарибалди, бивш член на мексиканския преговарящ екип в РКОНКП, Перу се опитва задкулисно да достигне до споразумение за намаляване на емисиите от обезлесяването. Перу не е важен участник в преговорите за климата. Стърн отбеляза в Лима, че чрез споразумението за насърчаване на търговията и сътрудничество за околната среда между САЩ и Перу \"Перу е сигнализирало ангажираност да работи тясно със САЩ за създаването на системи да управление на горите и околната среда ... докато създава широки икономически ползи от своите гори\". Той каза на събралите се перуанци, че Съединените щати приветстват \"проучените възможности за сътрудничество с вас и вашите съседи по амазонската НЕОЕ програма\". Посещението на Стърн може да е тънък намек за одобрение на тяхната роля в осигуряването на пазар за горски въглерод и предшественик на натиск от Вашингтон върху Перу за натрупване на местна подкрепа за Копенхагенското споразумение.Може би най-изненадваща беше визитата на Стърн в Кито, Еквадор. Съединените щати отрязаха 2,5 милиона долара помощи, когато Еквадор представи писмо, с което отказа да се присъедини към споразумението. В отговор еквадорският външен министър Рикардо Патиньо предложи на Съединените щати 2,5 милиона долара, ако Обама подпише протокола от Киото. По време на посещението Стърн каза дипломатично, че Съединените щати и Еквадор \"трябва да изявят желание да се слушат едни други и да говорят едни с други, като разменят възгледи \". Но той отхвърли идеята за изплащане на климатичния дълг, без да се замисля, като каза : \"исторически дълг, вина или престъпност, не, не го възприемам така\".Ще се опита ли Стърн да оправи отношенията със Съединените щати, знаейки че подкрепата от Еквадор - страна от амазонския басейн с наследство от изконна борба за право върху земята, ще подобри шансовете за сделка по НЕОЕ ? Усеща ли той пукнатини между Еквадор и Боливия, които могат да се използват за омиротворяването на латиноамериканската опозиция на Копенхагенското споразумение?Заграбване на нова земяВ свят, скован от въглерод, атмосферното пространство и правото да се замърсява се тълкуват като големи пари. Ако една многонационална схема за ограничаване и търговията, като Протокола от Киото, бъде приета глобално, правото да се излъчи тон въглероден облак би струвало някъде между 2 и 85 долара. Резултатът ще бъде международен пазар за въглерод на стойност трилиони долари. Това дава отражение върху добива на енергия от нисковъглеродни източници като водоцентралите, минералите, необходими за нови технологии като ефективни батерии, и земята, на която да се отглежда палмово масло, биомаса и въглеродозадържащи гори.Никой не знае това по-добре от Тод Стърн. В Националния аграрен университет в Перу той добави, че \"по-слабо развитите страни по света, които сега са бедни на ресурси, при глобалната енергийна система, базирана на изкопаеми горива, имат потенциала да станат ресурсно богати, когато слънцето, вятърът и земята бъдат впрегнати за създаването на енергийната основа на 21-ви век\". Той каза, че \"вече е налице състезание за създаването и овладяването на нови пазари за чистата енергия на 21-ви век\". Климатическата общност и политическите умници ще прекарат много време в интерпретиране на сигналите от тази визита и от бъдещите срещи на Стърн и другите американски представители по климата с чуждите страни. Този дебат по климатичната промяна се отнася за много повече неща, отколкото само за екологична стабилност. Глобалните климатични договори ще определят на чии страни ще бъде ограничен растежът, базиран на изкопаеми горива, и до каква степен. Последващите международни споразумения и вътрешни политики ще определят относителната важност на природните ресурси за глобалната икономика. Поради неравномерното разпределение на минералите, горите, земеделските почви и водата, осигуряването на достъп до тези и други ресурси ще бъде, а в много региони вече е, център на геополитическа борба, ускорена от климатичната промяна.\n\t\t\t",

مثل تلك المشاكل الأخرى - من خلال تضافر الجهود ل\"تطهير\" سلوك استخدام مواردنا، عن طريق استبدال المنتجات \"الخضراء\" عن تلك العادية، من خلال الحد من تسرب المواد السامة، وهلم جرا.لكن ارتفاع حرارة الأرض ليست مشكلة \"بيئية\" بنفس معنى المشاكل الأخرى - إنها مشكلة طاقية، أولا وقبل كل شيء. يتم تزويد ما يقارب 90٪ من الطاقة العالمية عبر حرق الوقود الأحفوري، وفي كل مرة نحرق هذه الأنواع من الوقود لتوليد الطاقة نطلق ثاني أكسيد الكربون في الغلاف الجوي؛ ثاني أكسيد الكربون، بدوره، هو العنصر الرئيسي ل\"الغازات الدفيئة\" (GHGs) المسؤولة عن ارتفاع درجة حرارة كوكب الأرض. استخدام الطاقة وتغير المناخ هما وجهان لعملة واحدة.تبعية الوقود الأحفوري ندرس مسألة الوضع في الولايات المتحدة. وفقا لوزارة الطاقة (DoE)، تشكل انبعاثات ثاني أكسيد الكربون 84٪ من انبعاثات الغازات الدفيئة لهذه الأمة. تنبعث معظم 98٪ من مجموع انبعاثات ثاني أكسيد الكربون الأمريكية نتيجة لاحتراق الوقود الأحفوري، والتي توفر حاليا ما يقارب 86٪ من إمدادات الطاقة الإجمالية في أمريكا. وهذا يعني أن هناك ارتباط وثيق بين استخدام الطاقة و انبعاثات ثاني أكسيد الكربون: نحن الأكثر الذين نستهلك الطاقة، الأكثر الذين نطلق ثاني أكسيد الكربون في الغلاف الجوي، والأكثر الذين نساهم في تراكم الغازات الدفيئة (GHGs).نظرا لأن الأميركيين لا يبدون أي ميل نحو الحد من استهلاكهم للوقود الأحفوري – بل بدلاً من ذلك يتم استخدام أكثر فأكثر الوقود من أي وقت– فلا يمكن للمرء أن يتوقع أي انخفاض في انبعاثات الغازات الدفيئة بالولايات المتحدة في المستقبل. وفقا لوزارة الطاقة، من المتوقع أن تستهلك الولايات المتحدة 35٪ أكثر من النفط والفحم والغاز جميعا بحلول عام 2030 مقارنة مما كان عليه في عام 2004؛ ليس من المستغرب، ويتوقع أن ترتفع انبعاثات غاز ثاني أكسيد الكربون في البلاد بنفس النسبة تقريبا خلال هذه الفترة. إذا ثبتت هذه التوقعات الدقيقة، سوف يصل مجموع انبعاثات ثاني أكسيد الكربون في الولايات المتحدة في عام 2030 إلى 8.1 بليون طن متري، والتي ستتولد 42٪ منها من خلال استهلاك النفط (معظمها في السيارات وعربات النقل والشاحنات، والحافلات)،40  ٪ عن طريق حرق الفحم (لإنتاج الكهرباء بالأساس)، والباقي من احتراق الغاز الطبيعي (في التدفئة المنزلية وتوليد الكهرباء بالدرجة الأولى). وأي نشاط آخر في الولايات المتحدة سوف يكون قريب من حيث توليد انبعاثات الغازات الدفيئة.ما ينطبق على الولايات المتحدة ينطبق أيضا على سائر الدول الصناعية و المصنّعة، بما في ذلك الصين والهند. وعلى الرغم من أن عدد قليل من الدول قد يعتمد على الطاقة النووية أو الطاقة المتجددة بدرجة أكبر من الولايات المتحدة، إلا أن جميعها ما زالت تواصل استهلاك الوقود الأحفوري وتبعث كميات كبيرة من ثاني أكسيد الكربون، وبذلك تساهم كل الدول في تسارع تغير المناخ العالمي. وفقا لوزارة الطاقة، من المتوقع أن تزيد الانبعاثات العالمية من ثاني أكسيد الكربون بنسبة مخيفة ب75٪ بين عامي 2003 و 2030، من 25.0 إلى 43.7 بليون طن متريا. قد يتحدث الناس عن تباطؤ معدل تغير المناخ، ولكن إذا ثبتت دقّة هذه الأرقام، فسيكون المناخ أكثر حرارة بكثير في العقود القادمة، وسوف يسفر هذا عن التأثيرات الأشد ضررا التي تنبأت بها الهيئة الحكومية الدولية المعنية بتغير المناخ (IPCC).وهذا ما يُنبئنا أن مشكلة الاحتباس الحراري لا يمكن فصلها عن مشكلة الطاقة. إذا استمر المجتمع البشري في استهلاك المزيد من الوقود الأحفوري لتوليد مزيدا من الطاقة، فإنه حتما سيزيد من انبعاث ثاني أكسيد الكربون بحيث يعجل تراكم الغازات الدفيئة في الغلاف الجوي، وبالتالي يتسبب مما لا رجعة فيه في تغير المناخ. ومهما فعلنا على الهامش لتحسين هذه العملية - مثل زراعة الأشجار لامتصاص البعض من انبعاثات الكربون أو إبطاء معدل إزالة الغابات – سيكون تأثير ضئيل فقط طالما أن المشكلة المركزية في استهلاك الوقود الأحفوري تبقى على حالها.حالة إنكاريرغب العديد من القادة السياسيين و رجال الأعمال في إنكار هذه الحقيقة الأساسية. وقد يدّعون قبول الاستنتاجات التي خلص إليها تقرير الهيئة الحكومية الدولية المعنية بتغير المناخ IPCC. وسيعترفون بأن هناك حاجة إلى اتخاذ إجراءات صارمة لوقف تراكم الغازات المسببة للاحتباس الحراري. ولكن مع ذلك فإنهم سيسعون إلى حماية سياسة الطاقة من التغيير الجوهري.نموذجية هذا النهج هي كلمة قدمها ريكس تيلرسون، الرئيس التنفيذي لشركة اكسون موبيل، في مؤتمر نظمته شركة كامبريدج لأبحاث الطاقة في 13 فبراير. باعتباره رئيس أكبر شركة للطاقة في العالم للتداول العام ، يلقى تيلرسون اهتماما خاصا عندما يتحدث. وأولى أهمية خاصة لتعليقات سلفه لي ريموند الذي استخف في كثير من الأحيان بعلم الاحتباس الحراري. نعم، اعترف تيلرسون، أنّ مستويات ثاني أكسيد الكربون في الغلاف الجوي كانت في تزايد، وهذا ما ساهم في ارتفاع درجة حرارة الكوكب تدريجيا. ولكن أضاف بعد ذلك، بميزة لغة الصناعة، \"إن المزايا الكبرى التي يتمتع بها النفط والغاز الطبيعي توفر قيمة اقتصادية لا مثيل لها من قبل أي بديل آخر\". وأضاف أنّه سيكون خطأ فادحا الإسراع في تطوير بدائل الطاقة عندما لا تزال تبعات ارتفاع درجة حرارة الأرض غير مفهومة فهما كاملا.منطق هذا النمط من التفكير لا مفر منه. استمرار إنتاج الوقود الأحفوري لدعم نظامنا الاقتصادي الحالي أمر مهم للغاية من أجل السماح بالمضي في اتجاه ازدهار الكوكب. خذ نصيب في هذا النمط من التفكير، ويمكنك أن تقول وداعا لأي أمل في إبطاء تراكم الغازات الدفيئة في الغلاف الجوي- فما بالك بالعكس -.ما يجب القيام بهمع ذلك، إذا ما نسعى دائما لحماية المناخ طالما لا يزال هناك متسع من الوقت للقيام بذلك، ينبغي علينا أن نتولى تحولا جذريا في سلوكياتنا الطاقية: لا شيء آخر يمكن أن يحدث فارقا كبيرا. ومن الناحية العملية، هذا يؤول إلى شرطين أساسيين. يجب علينا تقليص استهلاكنا للوقود الأحفوري بصورة ملحوظة، كما يجب أن نجد السبل لالتقاط ودفن مشتقات الوقود الأحفوري من الكربون الذي نقوم باستهلاكه.وقد اقتُرحت استراتيجيات مختلفة لتحقيق هذه الأهداف. وينبغي الاستفادة إلى أقصى حد ممكن من تلك التي تقدم تعهدات كبيرة. ليس هذا المكان المناسب لتقييم هذه الاستراتيجيات بالتفصيل، باستثناء تقديم بعض الملاحظات العامة.أولا، كما لاحظنا، يتم إنتاج 42٪ من انبعاثات ثاني أكسيد الكربون الأمريكية (الحصة الأكبر) من خلال احتراق النفط، لذلك فإن أي شيء من شأنه أن يقلل من استهلاك النفط - مثل معايير كفاءة عالية في استهلاك وقود محركات السيارات، حوافز كبيرة للسيارات الهجينة، استخدام للايثانول، تحسين المواصلات العمومية، تجميع السيارات، وغيرها - ينبغي أن يشكل أولوية رئيسية.ثانيا، نظرا لأن احتراق الفحم في محطات توليد الطاقة الكهربائية هو أكبر مصدر قادم لثاني أكسيد الكربون، فإن تحسين كفاءة هذه المصانع والتصفية خارج الانبعاثات الضارة يجب أن تكون على رأس قائمة الأولويات.وأخيرا، ينبغي أن نسرع البحث على تقنيات جديدة واعدة لالتقاط و \"حجز\" الكربون خلال احتراق الوقود الأحفوري عند توليد الكهرباء. تدعو بعض هذه الخطط إلى دفن الكربون الزائد فقاع مناجم الفحم وآبار النفط – إنه استخدام عملي للغاية لهذه الذخائر المهملة، لكن فقط إذا أمكن إثبات أن لا شيء سيتسرب مرة أخرى من الكربون في الجو، إضافة إلى تراكم الغازات الدفيئة.ظاهرة الاحتباس الحراري هي مشكلة طاقية، فلا يمكننا تحقيق على حد سواء زيادة في الاستخدام التقليدي للوقود الأحفوري وكوكب صالح للسكن. إما هذا أو ذاك. يجب علينا وضع مسار لمستقبل الطاقة الذي من شأنه تلبية حاجياتنا الأساسية من الطاقة (دون إسراف) وأيضا إنقاذ المناخ طالما لا يزال هناك وقت. ويمكن أن تكون التكنولوجيا متاحة لنا للقيام بذلك، لكن فقط إذا اتخذنا قرار تطويرها بسرعة وعلى نطاق واسع جدا.\n\t\t\t",

Comprehensive assessment of the probands included separate Washington University in St. Louis Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (WASH-U-KSADS) interviews of parents about their children and of children about themselves. Hypersexuality and uninhibited people-seeking were assessed from the corresponding WASH-U-KSADS items. Microsatellite genotyping of the AVPR1A repeats was conducted using fluorescently labeled primers and detected by laser-induced fluorescence. Alleles were determined with the assistance of semi-automated allele-calling software.

Using postcode sector data for Scotland (UK), this study tests the hypothesis of spatial heterogeneity in the relationship between area-level deprivation and mortality to determine if contextual differences in the West vs. the rest of Scotland influence this relationship. Research into health inequalities frequently fails to recognise spatial heterogeneity in the deprivation-health relationship, assuming that global relationships apply uniformly across geographical areas. In this study, exploratory spatial data analysis methods are used to assess local patterns in deprivation and mortality. Spatial regression models are then implemented to examine the relationship between deprivation and mortality more formally.', 'The initial exploratory spatial data analysis reveals concentrations of high standardized mortality ratios (SMR) and deprivation (hotspots) in the West of Scotland and concentrations of low values (coldspots) for both variables in the rest of the country. The main spatial regression result is that deprivation is the only variable that is highly significantly correlated with all-cause mortality in all models. However, in contrast to the expected spatial heterogeneity in the deprivation-mortality relationship, this relation does not vary between regions in any of the models. This result is robust to a number of specifications, including weighting for population size, controlling for spatial autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity, assuming a non-linear relationship between mortality and socio-economic deprivation, separating the dependent variable into male and female SMRs, and distinguishing between West, North and Southeast regions. The rejection of the hypothesis of spatial heterogeneity in the relationship between socio-economic deprivation and mortality complements prior research on the stability of the deprivation-mortality relationship over time.']",

The ideal time for discontinuation before surgery is an issue, particularly in surgeries with a high bleeding risk or in which neuraxial anesthesia is used. Guidance for perioperative bridging with fondaparinux must be derived from pharmacokinetic data, surgical prophylaxis trials, case reports, and anesthesia guidelines.

Three case reports cited the use of fondaparinux sodium as perioperative bridge therapy; one used a 2.5-mg dose, and the other two used a full treatment dose of 7.5 mg. Furthermore, professional anesthesia guidelines conflict in their recommendations regarding the timing of drug administration with neuraxial catheter use.

Radiation doses for both the portal venous and delayed phases, when available, were analyzed to assess the effect of the delayed phase on overall radiation exposure.', 'Forty-two patients (4.2%) had findings that were further characterized or were observed only in the delayed phase. Most were incidental findings that could have been confirmed at noninvasive follow-up imaging, such as sonography or unenhanced CT or MRI. The most common findings were liver hemangioma (n = 12), adrenal adenoma (n = 12), and parapelvic renal cysts (n = 6). The most important finding was detection of a renal mass in one patient (0.1%). The mass was seen only on the delayed phase images but was difficult to appreciate in the portal venous phase. In the other 958 patients (95.8%), delayed imaging was of no benefit.

All controls were confirmed not to have spondylolysis on the basis of computed tomographic scanning, magnetic resonance imaging, or bone scanning.

The slides were randomly presented to four pediatric spine surgeons for diagnosis, with four-view slides being presented first, followed by two-view slides. The slides for twenty random patients were later reanalyzed in order to calculate of intra-rater agreement. A power analysis demonstrated that this study was adequately powered. Inter-rater and intra-rater agreement were assessed on the basis of the percentage of overall agreement and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs).

It tasted like bubble gum. He liked that part.  Then the dentist came in and examined his mouth, to make sure the lady cleaned them well. He was also checking for cavities.

I decided to go ahead and set the dining table before everyone arrived. I put the place mats in front of each chair at the table. I then placed dinner plates on each of the place mats. I folded my favorite napkins neatly and placed on beside each plate. I also made sure that everyone had a fork, knife and spoon. The last thing I put at each place were the glasses. I gave every person one glass for water and another glass for any other drink they might want. I had tea, soda and milk for the children. Before I placed all this on the table, I made sure to put my favorite red tablecloth on the table. Everyone sat to eat and we had a delicious dinner together.",

I like the stuff that has a really strong smell. I closed the lid and let it wash. After it was done, I removed them and placed the in the dryer with a fabric softener sheet. They took an hour to dry. I removed them while they were still warm and carried them to my room. I placed the fitted sheet on, as the corners played a game of popping off as I ran from corner to corner putting it back on.

I asked what kind of food she liked and she said sushi or Chinese. I was happy because that is also my favorite type of food. we set the date for the following Wednesday, we chose Wednesday because restaurants tend to be less crowded on a Wednesday after noon, and she has social anxiety. Wednesday came and I got up early and did my daily routine. I showered and dressed in my best casual yet classy clothing, put on my favorite cologne and made sure I had my phone, keys and wallet with cards inside. I called her to let her know I was on my way and would be there around 11 a.m. She was super happy sounding and said she'd be ready. I arrived and knocked on the door and was greeted by her in a beautiful and elegant sundress that made her bright green eyes and auburn hair pop. She was amazing. At the restaurant we were both very quiet, but smiled a lot at each other while stuffing out faces with freshly made sushi and egg rolls. I paid for us both and she offered to leave the tip.",

        "document_str": "\nГлобалното затопляне: става дума за енергиятаНай-накрая, след години усилия от решителни учени и активисти като Ал Гор, въпросът за глобалното затопляне започна да получава международното внимание, от което отчаяно се нуждае. Публикуването на 2 февруари на последния доклад от Междуправителствения панел по климатичната промяна (МПКП), който предава най-убедителното досега доказателство за човешката отговорност за покачването на глобалните температури, доведе до голям отзвук в световната преса. Но докато расте единомислието за отговорността на хората за глобалното затопляне, политиците трябва да постигнат съгласие относно основната кауза - нашето ненамаляващо потребление на изкопаеми горива.Когато проблемът за глобалното затопляне бъде поставен за обществено обсъждане, като в \"Неудобната истина\" на Гор, той се характеризира основно като проблем на околната среда, свързан със замърсяването на водата и въздуха, злоупотребата с пестициди и т.н. Това означава, че той може да се разреши, подобно на другите проблеми, чрез съгласуван опит за \"изчистване\" на поведението ни при управление на ресурсите, като използваме \"зелени\" заместители на обикновените продукти и ограничим освобождаването на токсични субстанции и т.н.Но глобалното затопляне не е проблем на околната среда в същия смисъл като останалите - той е преди всичко енергиен проблем. Почти 90% от световната енергия се добива чрез изгарянето на изкопаеми горива и всеки път, когато горим тези горива, за да произведем енергия, освобождаваме въглероден диоксид в атмосферата. Въглеродният диоксид е основният компонент на парниковите газове, които са причината за затоплянето на планетата. Енергийната консумация и климатичната промяна са двете страни на една монета.Зависимост от изкопемите гориваДа разгледаме ситуацията в Съединените щати. Според Департамента по енергията (ДпЕ), емисиите на въглероден диоксид представляват 84% от националните емисии на парникови газове. От всички американски емисии на въглероден диоксид 98% са в резултат от изгарянето на изкопаеми горива, които в момента осигуряват 84% от общото енергопроизводство. Това означава, че изразходването на енергията и емисиите на въглероден диоксид са взаимно свързани - колкото повече енергия използваме, толкова повече CO2 се освобождава в атмосферата и толкова повече допринасяме за натрупването на парникови газове.Тъй като американците не показват склонност към намаляване на консумацията на изкопаеми горива, даже напротив - използват ги все повече, може да се предположи, че САЩ няма да намалят емисиите на парникови газове за в бъдеще. Според Департамента по енергията Съединените щати планират да употребят 35% повече петрол, въглища и газ през 2030 г., отколкото през 2004 г. Не е учудващо, че се очаква националните емисии на въглероден диоксид да се покачат приблизително със същия процент за този период. Ако тези предвиждания се окажат верни, сборът на емисиите на въглероден диоксид на САЩ през 2030 г. ще достигне 8,1 милиарда метрични тона, от които 42% ще се генерират от употребата на петрол (главно от автомобилите, вановете, камионите и автобусите), 40% - от изгарянето на въглища (главно за производството на електричество), а останалото - от изгарянето на природен газ (отопление на домовете и производство на ток). Никоя друга дейност в Съединените щати не се доближава до тях, що се отнася до освобождаването на парникови газове. Реалността в Съединените щати важи и за други индустриализирани и индустриализиращи се страни, включително Китай и Индия. Въпреки че някои държави могат да разчитат на ядрена и възобновяема енергия повече от Съединените щати, всички продължават да използват изкопаеми горива и да излъчват големи количества въглероден диоксид, като така допринасят за ускоряването на климатичната промяна. Според Департамента по енергията глобалните емисии на въглероден диоксид ще се увеличат с плашещите 75% между 2003 г. и 2030 г. - от 2,5 до 4,7 милиарда метрични тона. Хората могат да говорят за забавяне на климатичната промяна, но ако тези цифри се окажат верни, климатът ще бъде много по-горещ през идващите десетилетия, което ще предизвика най-опустошителните последствия, предвидени от МПКП.Това ни подсказва, че проблемът за глобалното затопляне не може да бъде разделен от енергийния проблем. Ако човешката общност продължи да консумира повече изкопаеми горива, за да генерира енергия, то неминуемо ще се стигне до увеличаване на емисиите на въглероден диоксид, което ще забърза натрупването на парникови газове в атмосферата, причинявайки необратима климатична промяна. Каквото и да правим в допустимите граници, за да ограничим този процес - като засяването на дървета с цел те да абсорбират въглеродните емисии или да намалят степента на обезлесяване, то ще има незначителен ефект, докато основният проблем с консумацията на изкопаеми горива остава нерешен.Състояние на отричанеМного политически и бизнес лидери отричат тази основна истина. Те могат да твърдят, че приемат заключенията на доклада на МПКП. Те ще признаят нуждата от енергични действия за намаляването на натрупване на парникове газове. И въпреки това ще се стремят да закрилят енергийната политика от фундаментална промяна.Типично за този подход е изказването на Рекс Тиларсън, изпълнителен директор на Ексон Мобил, на конференция, организирана от Кеймбриджката колегия за енергийни изследвания на 13 февруари. Като шеф на най-голямата световна фирма за търговия с енергия, Тиларсън получава специално внимание, когато говори. Неговият предшественик Лий Реймънд често пренебрегваше причините за глабалното затопляне и коментарите му бяха без особена значимост. Тиларсън призна, че нивата на атмосферния въглероден диоксид се повишават и това допринася за постепенното затопляне на планетата. Той добави, в духа на бизнеса, че \"размерът на предимствата на петрола и природния газ в множество приложения е доказал икономическата си стойност, недостигната от никоя алтернатива\". Поради това ще бъде ужасна грешка да се бърза с развитието на енергийни алтернативи, докато последиците от глобалното затопляне все още не са напълно разбрани, добави той.  Логиката на този тип мислене е неизбежна. Продължителната употреба на изкопаеми горива, с цел да се поддържа икономическата система, е твърде важна, за да позволим на здравето на планетата да застане на пътя ѝ. В този ред на мисли можем да се сбогуваме с надеждата да намалим, да не говорим за отнемане, на натрупването на парникови газове в атмосферата.Какво да направимАко искаме да защитим климата, докато все още има време да го направим, трябва да приемем основна промяна в нашето енергийно поведение: всичко друго има незначителен ефект. На практика това се разделя на два основни постулата. Ние трябва значително да намалим потреблението си на изкопаеми горива и да намерим начини за улавяне и заравяне на въглеродните остатъчни продукти от изкопаемите горива, които използваме.Редица стратегии бяха предложени, за да постигнем тези цели. Тези, които са най-обещаващи, трябва да бъдат приложени във възможно най-широк обхват. Тук не е мястото да оценим тези стратегии в детайл, но ще направим няколко общи коментара. Първо, както беше отбелязано, понеже 42% от американските емисии на въглероден диоксид (най-голям дял) са продукт на изгорянето на нефт, всичко, което намалява потреблението на петрол - по-високи стандарти за ефикасност на двигателите, повече инвестиции в хибриди, по-голяма употреба на етанол, подобряване на публичния транспорт, общо ползване на автомобили и т.н. - трябва да стане главен приоритет. Второ, тъй като изгарянето на въглища в електроцентралите е следващият по големина източник на CO2, подобряването на тези централи и филтрирането на вредните емисии трябва да стане друг топприоритет.И накрая, трябва да ускорим изследванията на обещаващите нови техники за залавянето и \"секвестирането\" на въглерода по време на изгарянето на изкопаеми горива при генерирането на електричество. Някои от тези централи предлагат излишния въглерод да се заравя в изпразнени въглищни мини и нефтени кладенци - много практическа употреба на тези изоставени места, но само ако се докаже, че въглеродът няма да изтече в атмосферата, допринасяйки за натрупването на парникови газове.Глобалното затопляне е енергиен проблем и ние не можем едновременно да увеличаваме употребата на конвенционалните изкопаеми горива и да имаме обитаема планета. Или едното, или другото. Трябва да създадем план за бъдещето на енергията, който ще посрещне нашите основни (не разточителни) енергийни нужди и също така ще спаси климата, докато все още има време. Технологията да го постигнем е потенциално налична, но само ако вземем решението да я развием бързо и в широк обхват.\n\t\t\t",

Undescended testis is a common pediatric condition and is conventionally managed surgically by orchidopexy. A single scrotal incision orchidopexy has become accepted as a valid approach for patients with palpable undescended testicles. Because this approach also allows easy detection of atrophic testes or testicular remnants, it recently has also emerged as an alternative initial surgical approach to impalpable undescended testicles.', 'All orchidopexies performed between 2004 and 2008 at our university hospital were prospectively included in this study. A total of 194 scrotal orchidopexies were performed in 154 patients (mean age, 71 months; range, 4-229 months). In all cases a scrotal approach was chosen irrespective of the initial position or presence of an open processus vaginalis. Testicular position was examined at follow-up after a mean period of 10 months (3-22 months).', 'Overall, 36 of the 46 impalpable testicles (78%) could be diagnosed and treated accordingly, using only a scrotal incision. Conversion to laparoscopy was needed in 4 cases. A limited number of postoperative complications were seen. In all cases, the testes were palpable and remained in the scrotum on follow-up.']",

        "context": "\n\nReplacement Card for a Noncitizen Adult \nYou can replace your Social Security card for free if it is lost or stolen. However , you may not need to get a replacement card, knowing your Social Security number is what's important. You are limited to three 3 replacement cards in a year and 10 during your lifetime. Legal name changes and other exceptions do not count toward these limits. Also , you may not be affected by these limits if you can prove you need the card to prevent a significant hardship.

You cannot get a Social Security number for the sole purpose of obtaining a driver's license. Government benefits or services : If you do not have permission to work , you may apply for a Social Security number only if : A federal law requires you to provide your Social Security number to get a particular benefit or service ; or A state or local law requires you to provide your Social Security number to get general assistance benefits for which you already have qualified.

Topazes ran in a foamy stream Over the cover, the hands were studded With garnets, and seemed red roses, budded.  The face was of crystal, and engraved Upon it the figures flashed and waved With zircons, and beryls, and amethysts.  It took a week to make, and his trysts At night with the Shadow were his alone.  Paul swore not to speak till his task was done.  The night that the jewel was worthy to give.  Paul watched the long hours of daylight live To the faintest streak; then lit his light, And sharp against the wall's pure white The outline of the Shadow started Into form.  His burning-hearted Words so long imprisoned swelled To tumbling speech.  Like one compelled, He told the lady all his love, And holding out the watch above His head, he knelt, imploring some Littlest sign.  The Shadow was dumb. ",

These slow moving streams create different types of features than mountain streams. Slow moving water erodes the sides of their channels more than the bottom. Also, large curves in the stream form. These curves are called meanders. Meanders are caused by erosion and deposition. Remember, faster moving water causes erosion more quickly. Slower moving water erodes material more slowly. If water is moving slowly enough, the sediment being carried may settle out. This settling out, or dropping off, of sediment is deposition. The curves are called meanders because they slowly wander over the land. As meanders erode from side to side, they create a floodplain. This is a broad, flat area on both sides of a river. Eventually, a meander may become cut off from the rest of the river. This forms an oxbow lake. ",

        "document_str": "\nأمريكا اللاتينية : تغير المناخ لولايات سوينغسافر المبعوث الخاص الأميركي لتغير المناخ تود ستيرن مع مساعد وزير الخارجية لشؤون نصف الكرة الغربي أرتورو فالنزويلا إلى شيلي، وبيرو، والإكوادور الأسبوع الماضي لمناقشة تغير المناخ مع نظرائه في الحكومة والمجتمع المدني. وكان تعميق التعاون الثنائي والمتعدد الأطراف لزيادة النمو الاقتصادي، وقطع الغازات المسببة للاحتباس الحراري، ومساعدة الفئات المستضعفة بالمناخ من السكان، من ضمن البرنامج الرسمي.ولكن كان الهدف السياسي لهذه الزيارة هو دفع اتفاق كوبنهاغن – هو اتفاق مثير للجدل قدمته أمريكا إلى محادثات الأمم المتحدة  UNبشأن المناخ في عام 2009 والذي أعاقته العديد من بلدان أمريكا اللاتينية - قبل قمة المناخ في المكسيك في نهاية عام 2010.يبين ستيرن في جولته بأمريكا الجنوبية - قبل ثلاثة أسابيع فقط من الدورة المقبلة للتفاوض بشأن اتفاقية الأمم المتحدة المبدئية بشأن تغير المناخ (UNFCCC) في بون -  تزايد أهمية دور دول أمريكا اللاتينية في التوصل إلى اتفاق حول المناخ. عرض برنامج زيارة ستيرن نافذة على كيفية استخدام الولايات المتحدة للمناقشة بشأن المناخ كجزء من خطة أوسع لتأمين النفوذ السياسي، والتجارة، والحصول على موارد في نصف الكرة الغربي.أمريكا اللاتينية الناشئةكانت البلدان الغنية (\"الملحق 1\" في كلام اتفاقية الأمم المتحدة المبدئية بشأن تغير المناخ UNFCCC) لفترة طويلة في مركز المفاوضات المتعلقة بتغير المناخ. وسوية، تضمن هذه الدول سلطتها من خلال التحقيق في التصدعات الموجودة بالفعل بين البلدان النامية – غالبا ما تقوم بتأليب الدول الأكثر فقرا ضد الأخرى الناشئة اقتصاديا. ويتضمن الملحق 1 تمرير الدول مرارا وتكرارا مسؤولية فشل المفاوضات إلى البلدان النامية، غالبا ما تقوم بإلقاء اللوم على الصين والفلبين أو أي بلد آخر يرفض المضي مع الأحكام التي سوف تقوض المصالح الاقتصادية والبيئية للبلدان النامية بالأساس.وقد استعرضت البلدان النامية في G77 + الصين ​​(كتلة التفاوض التي تمثل أكثر من 130 دولة) قوتها الجماعية في المفاوضات المتعلقة بالمناخ في الآونة الأخيرة، لا سيما حول الحق في التنمية. وتعتبر الصين والهند، وكلاهما باعثان رئيسيان للغازات الدفيئة، لاعبان مؤثران لأن أي خطة للحد من الانبعاثات دون مشاركتهما لن توقف الفوضى بالمناخ. وتحتفظ دول الجزر الصغيرة والدول الإفريقية بالسلطة الأخلاقية، وذلك لأن تغير المناخ سوف يكون الأكثر تدميرا لشعوبها. وفي الوقت نفسه، لم تكن أمريكا اللاتينية في مركز النقاش المتعلق بالمناخ – حتى الآن.ستنعقد المفاوضات المتعلقة بالمناخ العالمي هذا العام في كانكون، بالمكسيك. إن الحكومة المكسيكية تحت ضغط شديد من أجل تجنب تكرار الفشل الذريع الذي كان في كوبنهاغن. في ذلك الوقت، تخبط المضيفون الدنمارك في الاضطرابات الإجرائية، وغادر المندوبون يرتجفون خارج قاعة المؤتمر حين اندلعت المظاهرات بالداخل، وفي نهاية المطاف لم تستطع حظيرة الدول المجتمعة اعتماد قرار شامل.تعتزم الحكومة المكسيكية إحراز تقدما كبيرا في عنصرين اثنين على الأقل من العناصر الرئيسية: تمويل المناخ واستخدام أسواق الكربون لخفض الانبعاثات الناتجة عن إزالة الغابات وتدهورها (REDD). في الوقت نفسه، إنها تحذر ضمنيا بأن آفاق التوصل إلى اتفاق بشأن المناخ العالمي لا تبدو واعدة. وسوف تكون كريستينا فيغيريس، المخضرمة 15 عاما من فريق كوستاريكا للتفاوض والموظفة كأمينة جديدة لاتفاقية تغير المناخ (UNFCCC)، مسؤولة عن ضمان عدم جنوح المفاوضات.قد وضعت البرازيل نفسها، وهي أكبر الدول التسعة التي تشكل حوض الأمازون، كشركة رائدة في خفض الانبعاثات الناتجة عن إزالة الغابات وتدهورها (REDD) في الأمريكتين. ومع ملايين الهكتارات من الأراضي واحتمال تريليونات من الدولارات على المحك - ناهيك عن حقوق الشعوب الأصلية وسيادة الدولة – فإن البرازيل هي اللاعب الرئيسي.بالإضافة إلى ذلك، برزت بوليفيا، جنبا إلى جنب مع الإكوادور ونيكاراغوا وفنزويلا، كمعقلا لعدالة المناخ. دعت بوليفيا إلى قمة خاصة بالغاضبين عن العملية الخالصة التي أدت إلى اتفاق كوبنهاغن، داعية جميع الحكومات والمجتمع المدني إلى عقد مؤتمر شعوب العالم بشأن تغير المناخ وحقوق الأرض الأم في كوتشابامبا بأفريل الجاري. وكان من نتائج هذا التجمع العالمي اتفاق الشعوب الذي تقدمت به بوليفيا رسميا إلى اتفاقية الأمم المتحدة الإطارية (UNFCCC) نيابة عن المجتمع المدني العالمي. وبصورة مخيبة للآمال، لم يعكس النص الرسمي أي شيء من هذا الاتفاق. ولكن نجحت بوليفيا في توليد الكتلة الحرجة للكثير من مضمونه، بما في ذلك احترام حقوق الشعوب الأصلية؛ رفض تعويض الكربون؛ تخفيضات فورية وعميقة في الغازات الدفيئة من الدول الصناعية، ونقل موارد مالية ضخمة من البلدان المتقدمة إلى البلدان النامية.جدول أعمال الولايات المتحدةسربت الولايات المتحدة بوضوح، في جدول أعمالها للمفاوضات المتعلقة بالمناخ الدولي، أهداف الاتصالات الإستراتيجية عن طريق الخطأ في أفريل. وكان في الجزء العلوي من القائمة \"[تعزيز] التصور بأن تشارك الولايات المتحدة بشكل بناء في مفاوضات الأمم المتحدة في محاولة لإنتاج نظام عالمي لمكافحة تغير المناخ\". وتلزم الوثيقة أيضا فريق التفاوض بالولايات المتحدة \"لخلق فهم واضح لمكانة CA [اتفاق كوبنهاغن] وعلى أهمية تفعيل كافة العناصر.\"يجسد اتفاق كوبنهاغن كل المطالب السياسية الرئيسية في الولايات المتحدة. لقد تم تخفيض التعهدات الملزمة للحد من انبعاثات الغازات الدفيئة بالعودة إلى عملية \"التعهد والمشاركة\" الطوعية. وقدمت هذه التعهدات حتى الآن تخفيضات تقتصر على نسبة 25-40 بالمائة من جانب الدول الغنية والتي يقول عنها العلماء في الفريق الحكومي الدولي المعني بتغير المناخ أنها ضرورية لتجنب الكارثة المناخية. وإن افتقاد هذه الأهداف لا يحمل أي عواقب قانونية.كذلك، تدبروا في أمر التمييز بين الدول التي أصدرت الغالبية العظمى من غازات الاحتباس الحراري على مر التاريخ، وتلك التي انضمت مؤخرا إلى صفوف أكبر البواعث. ويتطلب اتفاق كوبنهاغن من جميع البلدان النامية - باستثناء دول الجزر الصغيرة والبلدان الأقل نموا - تنفيذ إجراءات التخفيف من الغازات الدفيئة. في الواقع، ينص الاتفاق فعلا على أكثر صرامة في الشفافية وفي متطلبات إعداد التقارير لدى تلك الدول مما هي عليه في البلدان الغنية. تعارض البلدان النامية كما هو متوقع الفكرة القائلة بأنها ينبغي أن تتأخذ تخفيضات في الانبعاثات الملزمة قبل البلدان الأكثر ثراء والبواعث الأكبر على هذا الكوكب. وأشاروا أيضا إلى أن تأثير تخفيضات مماثلة تكون مختلفة جدا للناس الذين يعيشون في الدول الغنية والفقيرة. على سبيل المثال، فإن 20 بالمائة من التخفيض في أسعار الفائدة الأمريكية قد يعني تخفيض المعدل ​​ إلى 16 طن من الكربون سنويا للشخص الواحد. وقد يحرك نفس التخفيض في الهند معدل الأثر الكربوني من 1.6 طن إلى 1.3 طن في السنة. وبعبارة أخرى، حتى ولو كان تخفيضا متواضعا في البلدان المترفة قد يفعل شيئا يذكر من أجل تغيير نوعية حياة الناس، ولكن سيكون قفل البلدان النامية في الفقر.يمجد اتفاق كوبنهاغن حوافز السوق لتحقيق خفض الانبعاثات الناتجة عن إزالة الغابات وتدهورها (REDD) و التداول عبر الانترنت لكربون الغابات. إن خفض الانبعاثات الناتجة عن إزالة الغابات وتدهورها (REDD) أمر بالغ الأهمية لتعهد الولايات المتحدة القاضي بخفض الانبعاثات بنسبة 17 بالمائة من مستويات عام 2005 بحلول عام 2020. وإن شراء اعتمادات كربون الغابات يعد أرخص وأسرع وأسهل من تنظيف المصانع المسببة للتلوث ومحطات توليد الكهرباء. بدلا من خفض الانبعاثات في الولايات المتحدة، ستدفع الدول الملوثة بلدان الغابات إلى الحفاظ على أشجارها الدائمة، ومن ثم \"شراء\" الكربون الذي في الأشجار لتعويض استمرار إطلاقها للغازات الدفيئة في الداخل. غير أن الإزاحة بشكل عام، وإزاحة الغابات على وجه الخصوص قد واجهت مقاومة من علماء المناخ، والممولين، والمجتمعات المحلية لأنها صعبة التحقق وتؤثر على الاستخدامات التقليدية للغابات والحق فيها.بالإضافة إلى ذلك، يحدد الاتفاق المعالم لتمويل المناخ. ويتعهد بأن البلدان المتقدمة ستعبئ ما يصل إلى 30 مليار دولار بحلول عام 2012 و 100 مليار دولار سنويا بحلول عام 2020 لصالح البلدان النامية من أجل التكيف مع تغير المناخ والانتقال إلى مسارات تنمية منخفضة الكربون.تجادل دول مثل بوليفيا والإكوادور بأن الدول الغنية، بدلا من ذلك، مدينة للعالم النامي \"بدين المناخ\". وينبغي على البلدان المدرجة بالملحق 1 تسديد هذه الديون، في جزء منه، من خلال تقليل الانبعاثات بشكل كبير لإفساح المجال لسكان البلدان غير المدرجة في الملحق 1 لاستخدام حصتها العادلة من الغلاف الجوي لكوكب الأرض. ولأن العالم الصناعي هو في تلك الديون، فيعتقد أنصار عدالة المناخ أنه ليس هناك أي مجال لتعويض أي انبعاثات للكربون بواسطة شراء أرصدة الكربون. بدلا من ذلك، فإنهم يطالبون الدول الغنية بتغطية تكاليف المجتمعات من أجل التكيف مع عالم الاحتباس الحراري، و بالوفاء بالتزاماتها المنصوص عليها في اتفاقية الأمم المتحدة الإطارية لأجل تقديم الدعم للانتقال إلى التنمية منخفضة الكربون. وفقا للبيانات الصادرة عن برنامج الأمم المتحدة الإنمائي، UNFCCC، والبنك الدولي، فإن ال100 مليار دولار السنوية المحددة في الاتفاق تعتبر غير كافية تماما لتلبية هذه الاحتياجات.في أولى محطتيه في شيلي وبيرو الأسبوع الماضي ، وبخ ستيرن بشكل غير مباشر منتقدي اتفاق كوبنهاغن، قائلا أن \"بالتأكيد أن المواقف التي لا يمكن أن يتقبلها الآخرين لن تنهض بالكرة\". ومع ذلك عندما تؤكد الولايات المتحدة على المواقف التي تتعارض مع مصالح البلدان النامية، فيتوقع من الأمم الأقل قوة أن تندرج في الخط أو تسقط بعيدا عن دعمها.لإضافة ثقل إلى تحذيرها من أن البلدان لا يمكنها \"انتقاء الكرز\" أي القطع التي تحلو لها من الاتفاق، قطعت الولايات المتحدة 3 ملايين دولار في تمويل المناخ لبوليفيا و 2.5 مليون دولار للإكوادور. وذكر ستيرن أن التمويل تم \"التوافق عليه كجزء من اتفاق كوبنهاغن، وكمسألة عامة، فالولايات المتحدة سوف تستخدم أموالها للذهاب إلى البلدان التي أبدت اهتماما كي تكون جزءا من الاتفاق\".يبدو أن \"النموذج الأمريكي الجديد لدبلوماسية المناخ\" الذي قدمه مفاوضو المناخ في يونيو/حزيران، يشمل على ابتزاز البلدان النامية التي تحتاج بشدة إلى الدعم للتعامل مع العواقب المترتبة عن الأزمة التي لم يتسببوا فيها.ستيرن يذهب إلى الجنوبأشار تود ستيرن كذلك في أهداف الاتصالات الإستراتيجية المسربة أنه تم اقتراح \"النظر في سلسلة من الخطابات السياسة / المنتديات العامة خلال الرحلات إلى الخارج لجعل قضيتنا مباشرة نحو العالم النامي\".كانت المحطة الأولى في جولة ستيرن هي شيلي – البلد الذي عمل، مع كولومبيا، على إقناع بوليفيا وغيرها من البلدان النامية لدعم الاتفاق. في خطابه أمام الطلاب وأعضاء هيئة التدريس، الذين اجتمعوا في كلية الاقتصاد والأعمال التجارية بجامعة شيلي، هنأ ستيرن شيلي لدعمها \"اتفاق كوبنهاغن\". وسلط الضوء على الحاجة إلى زيادة التنسيق الإقليمي ودعا الأمريكتين إلى تثبيت المزيد من الطاقة النظيفة من أجل \"توسيع دائرة الرخاء في جميع أنحاء نصف الكرة الغربي، وكذلك خفض انبعاثات الكربون لدينا\".ما لم يذكره ستيرن هو أن شيلي، باعتبارها واحدة من الشركات العالمية الرائدة في مجال الطاقة المائية، تولد الملايين من أرصدة الكربون التي ستتمنى البلدان المتقدمة لو أنها تتعهد بالتزامات لخفض الانبعاثات في كانكون أو في السنة الموالية. وأنشأت الولايات المتحدة بالفعل علاقات اقتصادية وثيقة مع شيلي في اتفاقية التجارة الحرة الموقعة بين البلدين في عام 2004، ولا تزال الخطط لتحرير التجارة بالكامل بحلول عام 2016 جارية. وقد تكون الطاقة وأرصدة الكربون الوفيرة هما السلعتين اللتين ستسوق لهما الولايات المتحدة في ذلك الوقت.قد تكون أيضا بيرو، البلد الذي كان له اتفاقية تجارة حرة مع الولايات المتحدة منذ أوائل عام 2009، مصدرا هاما لأرصدة الكربون الرخيصة، وغالبا بنفس الطريقة التي تجعل الآن المعادن والفلزات في متناول الشركات حتى في الشمال. وفقا لخوسيه البرتو غاريبالدي، عضو سابق في فريق التفاوض بشأن اتفاقية الأمم المتحدة الإطارية (UNFCCC) بالمكسيك، قد تم مناورة بيرو وراء الكواليس للتوصل إلى اتفاق بشأن خفض الانبعاثات الناتجة عن إزالة الغابات. فلم تكن بيرو لاعبا رئيسيا في مفاوضات المناخ. ولكن لاحظ ستيرن في ليما أن من خلال تعزيز التجارة بين الولايات المتحدة والبيرو واتفاق التعاون البيئي، \" أبدت بيرو التزاما للعمل بشكل وثيق مع الولايات المتحدة لإنشاء الغابات ونظم إدارة البيئة ... أثناء توليد قاعدة عريضة للمنافع الاقتصادية من غاباتها\". وقال ستيرن لمواطني بيرو المجتمعين هناك أن الولايات المتحدة ترحب ب\"استكشاف إمكانيات للتعاون معكم ومع جيرانكم على برنامج الأمازون لخفض الانبعاثات الناتجة عن إزالة الغابات وتدهورها (REDD)\". قد تكون زيارة ستيرن إشارة خفية للموافقة على دورها في تأمين سوق كربون الغابات وتمهيدا من واشنطن للضغط على البيرو لحشد الدعم الإقليمي لاتفاق كوبنهاغن.ربما كان الأكثر إثارة للدهشة هو محطة ستيرن في كيتو، بالإكوادور. حيث خفضت الولايات المتحدة 2.5 مليون دولار من الدعم عندما سلمت الإكوادور رسالة بأنها لن تنضم إلى الاتفاق. وردا على ذلك عرض وزير الخارجية الإكوادوري ريكاردو باتينيو ال2.5 مليون دولار الخاصة بالولايات المتحدة إذا وقع أوباما على بروتوكول كيوتو. وخلال زيارته، قال ستيرن بطريقة دبلوماسية أن الولايات المتحدة والإكوادور \"يجب أن تكون على استعداد للاستماع إلى بعضها البعض وتتحدث مع بعضها البعض وتتبادل وجهات النظر\". لكنه رفض فكرة تسديد الديون المتعلقة بالمناخ من جهة، قائلا أن \"الدين التاريخي أو الذنب أو الجرم، فلا. أنا لا أرى الأمر على هذا النحو\".هل سيحاول ستيرن إصلاح العلاقة مع الولايات المتحدة، مع العلم أن الدعم من الإكوادور - دولة حوض الأمازون مع إرث نضال السكان الأصليين من أجل حقوق الأرض - من شأنه أن يحسن فرص التوصل إلى اتفاق بشأن خفض الانبعاثات الناتجة عن إزالة الغابات وتدهورها (REDD)؟ هل أنه يشعر بفجوة بين الإكوادور وبوليفيا والتي يمكن استغلالها لتهدئة معارضة أمريكا اللاتينية لاتفاق كوبنهاغن؟الاستيلاء على الأراضي الجديدةفي عالم الكربون المقيد، يترجم الفضاء الجوي والحق في التلويث إلى دولارات كبيرة. إذا كان مخطط التزود والتجارة متعددة الأطراف مثل بروتوكول كيوتو هو موضع تنفيذ على الصعيد العالمي، فيمكن أن يستحق الحق في أن ينبعث نصف طن من الكربون في أي مكان بين 2 و 85 دولار. وسوف تكون النتيجة تريليون دولار بسوق الكربون الدولية. ثم هناك آثار لتأمين الطاقة من المصادر منخفضة الكربون مثل الطاقة المائية، والمعادن اللازمة للتكنولوجيات الجديدة مثل البطاريات الفعالة،  والأرض التي تنمي زيت النخيل، والكتلة الحيوية، وغابات عزل الكربون.لا أحد يعرف ذلك أفضل من تود ستيرن. ففي الجامعة الزراعية الوطنية في بيرو، أشار إلى أن \"البلدان الأقل نموا في جميع أنحاء العالم التي قد تجد نفسها فقيرة الموارد في الوقت الحالي - في نظام الطاقة العالمي القائم على الوقود الأحفوري- لديها القدرة لتصبح غنية بالموارد عندما يتم تسخير الشمس، والرياح، والأرض لإنشاء مؤسسة الطاقة للقرن الحادي والعشرين (21)\". وذكر أن \"هناك بالفعل سباقا على إنشاء والاستيلاء على الأسواق الجديدة للطاقة النظيفة للقرن الحادي والعشرين (21)\".سوف ينفق المجتمع المناخي والنقاد السياسيين وقتا طويلا لتفسير الإشارات من هذه الزيارة، ومن الاجتماعات المقبلة لستيرن وغيره من المسؤولين عن مناخ الولايات المتحدة التي تربطهم مع الدول الأجنبية. إن هذه المناقشة لتغير المناخ هي أكثر بكثير من الاستقرار البيئي. ستحدد معاهدات المناخ العالمي بلدان الوقود الأحفوري القائمة على النمو التي سيتم تقيدها وبأي مقدار. وسوف تحدد الاتفاقات الدولية الناتجة والسياسات المحلية، الأهمية النسبية للموارد الطبيعية في الاقتصاد العالمي. ونظراً لأن المعادن، والغابات، والتربة الزراعية، والمياه لا تنتشر بالتساوي في هذا الكوكب، فتأمين الوصول إلى هذه الموارد وغيرها سيكون - وفي كثير من المناطق بالفعل هو - في مركز الصراع الجيوسياسي الناجم عن تغير المناخ.\n\t\t\t",
