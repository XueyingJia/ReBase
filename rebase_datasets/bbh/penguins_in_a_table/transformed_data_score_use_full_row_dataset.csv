If fewer eggs are hatched, it would likely lead to the parent birds laying more eggs in the future to compensate and maintain their population. This is because birds have an innate drive to reproduce and ensure the survival of their species.

When fewer eggs hatch, the parent birds may perceive a need to lay more eggs in the next breeding season to make up for the lower hatch rate. This is a common survival mechanism in many bird species.

- The ages of patrick and michael are in the ratio of 3:5
- The ages of michael and monica are in the ratio of 3:5

To find the difference between the ages of patrick and monica, we can first find the individual ages.

Let's say the age of patrick is 3x, the age of michael is 5x, and the age of monica is 5y.

We know that the sum of their ages is 141, so:
3x + 5x + 5y = 141
8x + 5y = 141

We also know that the ratio of michael's age to patrick's age is 3:5, so:
5x = 3 * 3x
5x = 9x
x = 15

Therefore, patrick's age is 3x = 45, michael's age is 5x = 75, and monica's age is 5y = 96.

The difference between the ages of patrick and monica is 96 - 45 = 51.

If one of the penguins gets sick, it will likely not be able to forage for food as effectively. This means that the sick penguin will require more care and attention from the other penguins, especially the parents. 

The other penguins will not have more food available, as the sick penguin will still need to be fed. Similarly, the other penguins will not have less food available, as the healthy penguins will still be able to forage for food.

Therefore, the sickness of one penguin will have no effect on the amount of food available for the other penguins. The correct answer is (C) The sickness will have no effect on the other penguins."

From the given information, we know that the butterfly life cycle includes the following stages: egg, caterpillar, pupa, and adult. The adult butterflies feed on nectar and their population is 100.

If there are fewer adult butterflies, it will affect the reproduction and overall population of butterflies. With fewer adults, there will be fewer eggs laid, leading to a decrease in the number of caterpillars and subsequent life stages. This will result in a lower overall butterfly population.

We know the following from the table:
- Monarch lays 100 eggs
