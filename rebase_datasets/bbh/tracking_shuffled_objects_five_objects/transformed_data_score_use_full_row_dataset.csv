"In the early stages of planetary formation, the heat generated by the accretion process caused significant changes in the structure and composition of the planets. As the planets grew in size, the internal heating led to the differentiation of their structures into distinct layers.

"A cactus is a type of succulent plant that is well-adapted to survive in the harsh desert environment. The cactus has several unique features that help it thrive in these dry conditions. One key adaptation is the waxy stem covering and needle-shaped leaves.

The waxy stem covering and needle-shaped leaves of a cactus serve to reduce the loss of water from the plant to the surrounding air. The waxy coating helps prevent evaporation, while the needle-like shape minimizes the surface area exposed to the hot, dry air. This allows the cactus to conserve precious water resources and survive in the arid desert climate.

Which of the following best explains how the waxy stem covering and needle-shaped leaves of a cactus improve its ability to survive in the desert?

Options:
(A) They make the plant appetizing to small desert animals.
(B) They prevent the loss of oxygen through photosynthesis.
