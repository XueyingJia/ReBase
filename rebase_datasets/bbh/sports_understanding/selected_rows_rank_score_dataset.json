موقع پر ایسے ہی دو غیر متوقع اور دردناک بڑے سانحات پیش آئے۔ ایک حادثہ مناسک حج شروع ہونے سے پہلے کرین گرنے سے اور دوسرا منی کے مقام پر حادثہ درپیش آگیا۔ جس میں مجموعی طور پر مختلف ممالک سے وابستہ تقریبا ایک ہزار حجاج جان کی بازی ہار گئے۔ حج کا معاملہ مناسک حج کی وجہ سے دنیا کے دیگر بڑے بڑے اجتماعات سے بالکل مختلف ہے، جس کا انتظام یقیناً پیشگی منصوبہ بندی، اجتماع کی نفسیات سے آگاہی اور نظم و

سبب بننے والے اس المناک و دردنا ک حادثے پر مختلف ممالک، جن کے حجاج اس حادثے کا شکار ہوئے ہیں، کا غم و غصہ بجا ہے ۔ ان کا سعودی عرب سے یہ مطالبہ بھی بجا ہے کہ اس المناک حادثے کے ذمہ داروں کے تعین کے لیے تحقیقات شروع کر دیا جائے اور وہ حادثے کے شکار حجاج کے لواحقین سے معافی طلب کرے۔ نیز اس افسوس ناک موقع پر ہمیں ان تمام ممالک کے ساتھ بھی ہمدردی کا اظہار کرنا چاہیے جن کے حجاج اس حادثے کا شکار ہوئے ہیں۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>اس پورے حادثے کے پس منظر اور پیش منظر رپورٹنگ پر عالمی میڈیا منقسم ہے۔ عرب میڈیا، ایرانی میڈیا ، مغربی میڈیا اور پاکستانی میڈیا کی رپورٹنگ غیر جانبدار اور حقائق پر مبنی معروضی <annotation lang=\"en\">(Objective)</annotation> انداز میں ہونے کے بجائے مختلف ممالک کے مفادات کے تحت موضوعی <annotation lang=\"en\">(Subjective)</annotation> بن چکی ہے۔ اس لیے حادثے کا شکار ہو نے

ابھی تک قابل اعتبار اور کوئی ایک ورژن پر مبنی اعداد و شمار اور حقائق سامنے نہیں آئے ہیں۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>پاکستانی میڈیا کی زیادہ تر رپورٹس المناک حادثے کا ذمہ دار حاجیوں کو ہی ٹھہرا رہی ہیں۔ سعودی عرب کے مفتی اعظم کے بقول ایسے حادثات کو روکنا انسانی دسترس سے باہر ہے اس میں کسی کو ذمہ دار نہیں ٹھہرایا جا سکتا۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>ایک میزبان ریاست کے طور پر محفوظ حج کے لیے بہتر انتظامات کی ذمہ داری سعودی عرب کی بنتی ہے۔ جب بہتر انتظامات پر کریڈٹ لینے کا حقدار سعودی عرب ہے تو کسی قسم کی بد انتظامی کی صورت میں اسے ہر طرح کی ذمہ داری سے کیسے مبرا سمجھا جائے؟</p>\n\t\t\t<p>اس وقت اس حادثے کے شکار حجاج کے لواحقین کے درد اور کرب کا ادراک اور احساس کرنے والے کم اور اس حادثے پر مسلکی و ریاستی سیاست چلانے والے زیادہ نظر آرہے ہیں اور ایک طرف بعد از حادثہ اس کے نقصانات سے نمٹنے کے اقدامات کرنے، اعداد و شمار مرتب کرنے نیز لواحقین کو درست اور بر وقت معلومات فراہم کرنے کے حوالے سے حکومت پاکستان اور سعودی عرب دونوں کے حج مشنز کا رد عمل بھی بہت اذیت ناک حد تک قابل افسوس ہے۔ جبکہ دوسری طرف سانحہ منی پر انتہائی افسوس ناک رد عمل کے نتیجے میں امت مسلمہ بالعموم اور پاکستانی مذہبی طبقہ بالخصوص دو بلاکوں میں تقسیم نظر آرہا ہے ۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>سعودی بلاک کی طرف سے ظاہر کیے جانے والے رد عمل، خبریں، تجزیے، تبصرے، تصاویر، ویڈیوز کو ملاحظہ کیا جائے تو ایسا لگتا ہے کہ یہ حادثہ ایران کی پہلے سے طے شدہ سازشی منصوبے کی وجہ سے پیش آیا ہے۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>اسی طرح ایرانی بلاک کا جائزہ لیا جائے تو معلوم ہوتا ہے کہ یہ حادثہ سعودی عرب کی انتظامی نا اہلی، شاہی نقل و حرکت، منی میں کسی ایک سڑک کے بند کرنے کی وجہ سے پیش آیا ہے نیز یہ بھی کہا جا رہا ہے کہ شاہی خاندان کے اندرونی اختلافات اور شاہی خاندان کی باہمی دانستہ سازش بھی اس حادثے کی وجہ ہو سکتی ہے۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>مذکورہ منقسم تناظر میں اس المناک حادثے کو امت میں مزید تقسیم کا باعث بنایا جا رہا ہے ۔ تعجب ہے اس حادثے کی آڑ میں تحقیق و انصاف، رواداری و انسانی ہمدردی کے درس دینے والے بعض نامور دانشور، علما اور قائدین اس دلدل میں فرقہ وارانہ کیچڑ اچھالنے لگے ہیں۔ کچھ انتہاپسندوں نے یہ کمپین بھی چلانا شروع کر دی ہے کہ شیعوں اور خاص طور پر ایرانیوں کی حج پر پابندی لگا دی جائے جبکہ دوسری طرف اس واقعے کو بنیاد بنا کر سعودی عرب کی گزشتہ نو دہائیوں کے ریاستی جرائم کی فہرستیں تیار کرنا شروع کر دی ہے اور اس حادثے کو ریاستی سطح پر علاقائی مفادات کے حصول اور عالمی سطح پر رائے عامہ کو سعودی عرب کے خلاف ہموار کرنے کی کوشش کی جا رہی ہے ۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>ہمیں اس المناک حادثہ پر سعودی عرب یا ایران کے ساتھ اپنی موافقانہ یا مخالفانہ عصبیت سے بچتے ہوئے اس واقعے پر رنج و غم کا اظہار کرنا چاہیے۔ اسے ایران و سعودی عرب کی روایتی مخاصمانہ ریاستی پالیسی یا شیعہ سنی فرقہ وارانہ منافرت کا باعث نہیں بنانا چاہئے وگرنہ حادثے کا فرقہ وارانہ رخ مزید حادثات کو جنم دے سکتا ہے۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>عملی حقیقت یہی ہے کہ ریاستوں کی پالیسیاں صرف اپنے مفادات کے گرد گھومتی ہیں۔ جبکہ مسالک و مذاہب کی بنیادیں اقدار و اصول اور انسان دوست تعلیمات پر مبنی ہوتی ہیں۔ ہاں یہ الگ بات ہے کہ مذاہب و مسالک کے پیروکار دانستہ یا نادانستہ طور پر اکثر اوقات ریاستوں کی ترجمانی اور دفاع کو اپنے دینی اور مذہبی فرائض سمجھنے لگتے ہیں اور اس دفاع میں اپنی اصل تعلیمات سے ہی روگردانی کر رہے ہوتے ہیں ۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>امت مسلمہ کے مسائل ان دوممالک کی ریاستی ترجیحات کے تناظر میں زیر بحث لانے کے بجائے معروضی انداز میں ہی زیر بحث لانے کی ضرورت ہے۔ سعودی عرب اور ایران دونوں اپنے اپنے خاص و محدود زمان ومکان میں مقید دو مسلم ممالک ہیں جبکہ اہل سنت اور تشیع دونوں مکاتب فکر ان ممالک کی جغرافیائی اور تاریخی حدود میں مقید نہیں ہیں۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>اس ضمن میں واضح رہے !</p>\n\t\t\t<p>سعودی عرب پر تنقید کو اہل سنت، اہل حدیث یا اسلام پر تنقید نہ سمجھا جائے ۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>اسی طرح ایران پر تنقید کو تشیع یا اسلام پر تنقید نہ سمجھا جائے۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>اگر ہم سانحہ منی جیسے حادثات کے دوران حقائق کو پسِ پشت ڈال کر انہیں اپنے اپنے ریاستی، سیاسی اور مسلکی مفادات کے لیے استعمال کرنے سے باز نہ آئے تو یاد رکھیے مسلم معاشروں میں سچائی، عدل و انصاف اور اخلاقی اقدار کی موت واقع ہوتی رہے گی اور ہمارے دلوں اور دماغوں پر عصبیت، جھوٹ، ظلم اور منافقت کی حکومت قائم رہے گی جو سمجھنے والوں کے لیے ایسے حادثات سے بھی کئی گنا بڑا حادثہ ہے ۔</p>\n\t\t</section>\n\t</body>\n"

In contrast, the nurses' mean VAS predicted 865 admissions (47.3%), overestimating by 6.6% (p<0.0001). GAPS discriminated between admission and discharge as well as nurses, its AUC 0.876 compared with 0.875 for VAS (p=0.93). As a binary predictor, its accuracy was 80.6%, again comparable with VAS (79.0%), p=0.18. In the minority of attendances, when nurses felt at least 95% certain of the outcome, VAS' accuracy was excellent, at 92.4%. However, in the remaining majority, GAPS significantly outperformed VAS on calibration (+1.2% vs +9.2%, p<0.0001), discrimination (AUC 0.810 vs 0.759, p=0.001) and accuracy (75.1% vs 68.9%, p=0.0009).

Remission is defined as biochemical reversal of hypercortisolism with re-emergence of diurnal circadian rhythm, resolution of clinical features and adequate suppression on low-dose dexamethasone testing. Failure is defined as the absence of any of these features. Relapse is defined as the re-emergence of Cushing's disease more than one year after operation. Clinical features such as weight, sex, hypertension, associated endocrine disorders and smoking, biochemical studies including preoperative and postoperative serum cortisol, urine free cortisol, serum ACTH, radiological, histological and surgical findings were assessed in relation to these three groups to determine whether any factors could reliably predict failure or relapse after treatment.\", 'Of the 61 patients included in this study, 48 (78.7%) achieved initial remission and 13 (21.3%) failed treatment. Seven patients suffered subsequent relapse (range 22-158 months) in their condition after apparent remission, leaving a final group of 41 patients (67.2%) in the remission group. Tumour was identified at surgery in 52 patients, of whom 38 achieved remission. In comparison, only 3 of 9 patients in whom no tumour was identified achieved remission. This difference was significant (P = 0.048). When both radiological and histological findings were positive, the likelihood of achieving remission was significantly higher than if both modalities were negative (P = 0.038). There were significant differences between remission and failure groups when 2- and 6-week postoperative serum cortisol levels (P = 0.002 and 0.001, respectively) and 6-week postoperative urine free cortisol levels (P = 0.026) were compared. This allowed identification of patients who failed surgical treatment in the early postoperative period. Complications of surgery included transitory DI in 13, transitory CSF leak in 8 and transitory nasal discharge and cacosmia in 3. Twelve of 41 patients required some form of hormonal replacement therapy despite achieving long-term remission. Thirteen patients underwent a second operation, of whom 5 achieved remission.']",

ThinPrep and SurePath challenges were compared with classic preparations (smears, cytospins) for discordant responses.', 'There were 18 288 pathologist, 11 957 cytotechnologist, and 8086 \"laboratory\" responses available. Classic preparations comprised 90% (n = 34 551) of urine challenges; 9% (n = 3295) were ThinPrep and 1% (n = 485) were SurePath. Concordance to the general category of \"positive-malignant\" was seen in 92% of classic preparations, 96.5% of ThinPrep, and 94.6% of SurePath challenges (P<.001). These results were statistically different for the exact reference interpretation of HGUCA (P<.001) but not for adenocarcinoma (P = .22). Cytotechnologists demonstrate statistically better performance for the general category of \"positive-malignant\" compared with pathologists for all urinary slide types and for the exact reference interpretation of HGUCA (94% versus 91.1%; P<.001) but not adenocarcinoma (96.3% versus 95.8%; P = .77) or squamous cell carcinoma (93.6% versus 87.7%; P = .07).']",

PD on the visual analog scale (VAS) was assessed during a methacholine-induced FEV(1) decrease and specifically was quantified as the VAS slope and score at an FEV(1) decrease of 5 to 20%. BHR was assessed in terms of the provocative concentration of methacholine causing a 20% fall in FEV(1) (PC(20)). Eosinophil counts in induced sputum samples also were performed.

In patients with obstruction who were treated with ICSs, eosinophil counts related to PD negatively. Factor analysis yielded the following four factors that accounted for 70% of the variance in the data: ICS; eosinophil counts; FEV(1); and PC(20) loaded on separated factors with PD loading on the same factors as PC(20).

This study examines the ability of neutrophils isolated (over the first 24 hrs) from the peripheral blood of patients admitted after major trauma to migrate in response to interleukin-8. Interleukin-8 is elevated in the lung within 2 hrs of major trauma in patients who later develop ARDS, and thus it plays a central role in the recruitment of neutrophils to the lung and their subsequent activation. We hypothesized that enhanced interleukin-8-mediated neutrophil migratory activity in the early postinjury phase, before the development of ARDS, may be a crucial factor in the etiology of ARDS.', 'Prospective observational study.', 'University Hospital Wales, the Royal Gwent Hospital, and East Glamorgan General Hospital.

The neutrophil count in each specimen was measured, and the number of neutrophils migrating across porous tissue culture inserts in response to defined concentrations of interleukin-8 (0, 10, 30, and 100 ng/mL) was quantitated by peroxidase assay. Neutrophil counts in the whole blood specimens obtained from those later developing ARDS were elevated significantly at admission and declined rapidly throughout the next 24 hrs. Significantly greater numbers of trauma patients' neutrophils migrated to concentrations of interleukin-8 (30 and 100 ng/mL) at each time point when compared with normal volunteers (Mann-Whitney U test, p<.05).

Controlling for the severity-of-illness of the infant, the workload on the call night, and supervision with multiple linear regression, we found that interns ordered significantly (p = .02) greater numbers of arterial blood gases per infant than residents, amounting to some 0.33 blood gases per infant per call night (3.22 vs. 2.89 arterial blood gases per infant per night).

        "context.contexts": "['Cerebral hemispherectomy, a surgical procedure undergone to control intractable seizures, is becoming a standard procedure with more cases identified and treated early in life [33]. While the effect of the dominant hemisphere resection on spoken language has been extensively researched, little is known about reading abilities in individuals after left-sided resection. Left-lateralized phonological abilities are the key components of reading, i.e., grapheme-phoneme conversion skills [1]. These skills are critical for the acquisition of word-specific orthographic knowledge and have been shown to predict reading levels in average readers as well as in readers with mild cognitive disability [26]. Furthermore, impaired phonological processing has been implicated as the cognitive basis in struggling readers. Here, we explored the reading skills in participants who have undergone left cerebral hemispherectomy.', 'Seven individuals who have undergone left cerebral hemispherectomy to control intractable seizures associated with perinatal infarct have been recruited for this study. We examined if components of phonological processing that are shown to reliably separate average readers from struggling readers, i.e., phonological awareness, verbal memory, speed of retrieval, and size of vocabulary, show the same relationship to reading levels when they are mediated by the right hemisphere [2].', 'We found that about 60% of our group developed both word reading and paragraph reading in the average range. Phonological processing measured by both phonological awareness and nonword reading was unexpectedly spared in the majority of participants. Phonological awareness levels strongly correlated with word reading. Verbal memory, a component of phonological processing skills, together with receptive vocabulary size, positively correlated with reading levels similar to those reported in average readers. Receptive vocabulary, a bilateral function, was preserved to a certain degree similar to that of strongly left-lateralized phonological skills [3]. Later seizure onset was associated with better reading levels.']",

Secondary aims were to study the feasibility and acceptance of opioid PCT in patients with refractory breathlessness.', 'This was a pilot observational study with 18 inpatients with advanced disease and refractory breathlessness receiving opioid PCT. Breathlessness was measured on a self-reported numeric rating scale. Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale scores, Palliative Performance Scale scores, vital signs, and a self-developed patient satisfaction questionnaire were used for measuring secondary outcomes. Descriptive and interference analyses (Friedman test) and post hoc analyses (Wilcoxon tests and Bonferroni corrections) were performed.', 'Eighteen of 815 patients (advanced cancer; median age\\xa0=\\xa057.5\\xa0years [range 36-81]; 77.8% female) received breathlessness symptom control with opioid PCT; daily morphine equivalent dose at Day 1 was median\\xa0=\\xa020.3\\xa0mg (5.0-49.6\\xa0mg); Day 2: 13.0\\xa0mg (1.0-78.5\\xa0mg); Day 3: 16.0\\xa0mg (8.3-47.0\\xa0mg).

All animals were fed liquids for 3 days prior to procedure. The procedures were performed under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation. The flexible endoscope was passed per orally into the stomach and puncture of the gastric wall was performed with a needle knife. The puncture was extended to create a 1.5-cm incision using a pull-type sphincterotome, and a double-channel endoscope was advanced into the peritoneal cavity. The peritoneal cavity was insufflated with air through the endoscope. The spleen was visualized. The splenic vessels were ligated with endoscopic loops and clips, and then mesentery was dissected using electrocautery.', 'Endoscopic splenectomy was performed on six pigs. There were no complications during gastric incision and entrance into the peritoneal cavity. Visualization of the spleen and other intraperitoneal organs was very good.

Occult post-traumatic osteochondral injuries of the knee are trauma-related bone and/or cartilage damage missed at plain radiography.', 'We retrospectively selected 70 patients (men:women = 7:3; age range: 35 +/- 7 years) with a history of acute musculoskeletal trauma, negative conventional radiographs, pain and limited joint movements. All patients were submitted to conventional radiography, arthroscopy and MRI, the latter with 0.5 T units and T1-weighted SE. T2-weighted GE and FIR sequences with fat suppression.', 'We identified three types of occult post-traumatic injuries by morpho-topographic and signal intensity patterns: bone bruises (no. 25), subchondral (no. 33) and osteochondral (no. 35) injuries. Arthroscopy depicted 45 osteochondral and 19 chondral injuries. A bone bruise was defined as a typical subcortical area of signal loss, with various shapes, on T1-weighted images and of increased signal intensity on T2-weighted and FIR images. The cortical bone and articular cartilage were normal in all cases, while osteochondral injuries exhibited associated bone and cartilage damage with the same abnormal MR signal intensity. Sprain was the mechanism of injury in 52 cases, bruise in 12 and stress in 6. In 52 sprains (30 in valgus), the injury site was the lateral compartment in 92.3% of cases (100% in valgus), associated with meniscal damage in 73% of cases (90% in valgus) and with ligament injury in 90.4% (100% in valgus). In 12 bruises, the injury site was the lateral compartment in 58.3% of cases, the knee cap in 25% and the medial compartment in 16.7%; meniscal damage was associated in 25% of cases and ligament damage in 8.3%.

The aim of this research was to test whether an 8-week period of exposure to biofeedback training could improve the psychophysiological control over competitive anxiety and enhance athletic performance in participating subjects.', 'Participants of this study were highly competent athletes, each training in different sport disciplines. The experimental group consisted of 18 athletes (4 women, 14 men), whereas the Control group had 21 athletes (4 women, 17 men). All athletes were between 16 and 34 years old. The biofeedback device, Nexus 10, was used to detect and measure the psychophysiological responses of athletes. Athletes from both groups (control and experimental) were subjected to stress tests at the beginning of the study and once again at its conclusion. In between, the experimental group received training in biofeedback techniques. We then calculated the overall percentage of athletes in the experimental group compared with those in the control group who were able to control respiration, skin conductance, heart rate, blood flow amplitude, heart rate variability, and heart respiration coherence. One year following completion of the initial study, we questioned athletes from the experimental group, to determine whether they continued to use these skills and if they could detect any subsequent enhancement in their athletic performance.', 'We demonstrated that a greater number of participants in the experimental group were able to successfully control their psychophysiological parameters, in comparison to their peers in the control group. Significant results (p<0.05) were noted in regulation of GSR following short stress test conditions (p = 0.037), in regulation of HR after exposure to STROOP stressor (p = 0.037), in regulation of GSR following the Math and GSR stressors (p = 0.033, p = 0.409) and in achieving HR - breathing coherence following the math stressor (p = 0.042).']",

During alcohol withdrawal, a decreased secretion of beta E with a delayed normalization has been reported, but up to now only few data became available regarding the interaction of plasma beta E and psychopathological parameters.', 'The aim of our study was to test the hypothesis whether beta E during acute alcohol withdrawal is associated with anxiety, depression, and craving.', 'We observed self-rated anxiety, depression, and craving during alcohol withdrawal and assessed beta E levels (RIA) in a consecutive sample of 60 alcoholics on day 1 and day 14 after onset of withdrawal, and in 30 healthy volunteers. To control for mutual interactions of beta E and the pituitary-adrenocortical hormone secretion, plasma corticotropin (ACTH) and cortisol were also determined.', 'In accordance with prior studies, beta E was significantly lowered on day 1 and day 14 of alcohol withdrawal relative to controls. Plasma levels of ACTH correlated significantly with beta E in alcoholics at both time points and in controls, without differing significantly between the groups. Self-rated anxiety, depression, and alcohol craving decreased significantly between day 1 and day 14. Levels of beta E were inversely correlated with anxiety day 1 (r=-0.58) and day 14 (r=-0.71). Partial correlation coefficients controlling for ACTH plasma levels revealed that this correlation was largely independent from ACTH.

افسانوں کا رشتہ جوڑتی ہوئی یہ کتاب نویں جماعت میں ہی پڑھ لی تھی اور اسی نے داستان امیر حمزہ، اس کی ذیلی داستان طلسم ہوشربا اور ایرج نامہ، تورج نامہ کی تلاش پر اُکسایا۔ طلسم ہوشربا گھر میں مل گئی ، دوسری داستانیں لیاقت نیشنل لائبریری کے چیف لائبریرین سید ابن حسن قیصر مرحوم کی عنایت سے پڑھیں۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>چند ہفتوں پہلے کراچی، آرٹس کونسل کے انتخابات کے دنوں میں اختر وقار عظیم سے چند سرسری ملاقاتیں رہیں اور پھر عزیز دوست حسینہ معین کے توسط سے اختر وقار عظیم کی ٹی وی سے متعلق 50 سالہ یادیں 'ہم بھی وہیں موجود تھے' مجھ تک پہنچیں۔ان کی کتاب پر یوں تو کئی لوگوں نے لکھا ہے لیکن سب سے مختصر اور جامع اسلم اظہر کی تحریر ہے، جو انھوں نے انگریزی میں لکھی ۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>انھوں نے لکھا ہے کہ 1964 میں جب پاکستان ٹیلی وژن نے کام شروع کیا تو وہ لوگ جو اس نئے میڈیم سے منسلک ہوئے، ان میں سب سے لائق و فائق اختر وقار عظیم تھے۔ وہ ادب سے ان کی گہری وابستگی کا ذکر کرتے ہوئے لکھتے ہیں کہ ان کے والد لاہور کی روشن ادبی شخصیتوں میں سے ایک تھے، اختر اپنے اسی ادبی پس منظر کی وجہ سے بہت سے اہم لوگوں کو ٹیلی وژن کی طرف لے کر آئے جن میں صف اول کے ادیب، لوک اور کلاسیکی موسیقی سے تعلق رکھنے والے شامل تھے۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>یہ شاید اسلم اظہر کی آخری تحریروں میں سے ایک ہے۔ وہ خود اعلیٰ صلاحیتوں کے مالک تھے اور اپنے ارد گرد ایسے ہی لوگوں کو اکٹھا کرنے کا ہنر جانتے تھے۔ اختر وقار نے انھیں اپنی کتاب میں بہت محبت سے یاد کیا ہے۔ اختر مقابلے کے امتحان میں بیٹھنا چاہتے تھے لیکن اس سے پہلے انھیں پی ٹی وی میں ملازمت مل گئی۔ اس کے سال بھر بعد مقابلے کے امتحان کا وقت آیا اور اسلم اظہر کو ان کی خواہش کا علم ہوا تو ان کے اور اختر کے درمیان جو گفتگو ہوئی وہ کچھ یوں ہے:</p>\n\t\t\t<heading>\n\t\t\t\t<heading>\" اچھا تو تم مقابلے کے امتحان میں بیٹھنا چاہتے ہو\"؟ \" جی\" میرا جواب تھا۔</heading>\n\t\t\t\t<heading>\"رشوت لینے کا ارادہ ہے\"؟ \" جی نہیں خیال تو نہیں ہے\"۔ میرے جواب پر اسلم صاحب نے کہا: \" پھر تم ایک کرسی بھی اپنی تنخواہ سے نہیں خرید سکتے، یہیں کیوں نہیں رہتے ، ٹیلی وژن نیا ادارہ ہے، ملک میں شروع ہوئے اسے ابھی پانچ چھ سال ہوئے ہیں، یہاں آگے بڑھنے کے امکانات زیادہ ہیں\"۔ میں خاموش رہا۔ میری خاموشی پر انھوں نے کہا:</heading>\n\t\t\t\t<heading>\" پروفیسر صاحب سے میں خود بات کر لیتا ہوں\"۔ یہ کہہ کر لاہور میرے والد کو فون ملا لیا۔ \" میں اختر کو مقابلے کے امتحان میں شرکت سے منع کر کے یہیں ٹیلی وژن میں کام جاری رکھنے پر مجبور کر رہا ہوں، آپ کی اجازت چاہیے\"۔ اس پر انھیں جواب ملا: \"بچوں کو پڑھانا میری ذمے داری تھی، اب یہ کرنا کیا چاہتے ہیں، یہ فیصلہ انھیں خود کرنا ہے، مجھے کوئی اعتراض نہیں\"۔ اس کے بعد مقابلے کاامتحان پیچھے رہ گیا اور میری تمام توجہ ٹیلی وژن کی طرف مبذول ہو گئی۔</heading>\n\t\t\t</heading>\n\t\t\t<p>\" ہم بھی وہیں موجود تھے\" پی ٹی وی کے 50 برسوں کی کتھا کہانی ہے۔ اس میں کہیں تلخی نہیں، کسی کی عیب جوئی نہیں اور خود کو طرم خاں ثابت کرنے کی کوشش نہیں یہ اختر وقار عظیم کا کمال ہے۔ طرزِ تحریر کی روانی ہمیں بہائے لیے جاتی ہے اور اس زمانے کی جھلکیاں دکھاتی ہے جب سب ہی ایک دوسرے سے جڑے ہوئے تھے اور ایک خاندان کی طرح خوب سے خوب ترکی تلاش میں رہتے تھے۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>محترم فرہاد زیدی نے اس کتاب کی ابتدا میں اختر کا یہ جملہ دہرایا ہے کہ \" میری یاد داشت لوگوں کی خامیوں اور برائیوں کے معاملے میں خاصی کمزور ہے'۔ اب آپ ہی اندازہ لگائیے کہ ایک ایسے شخص کی یادداشتوں میں افراد کی عیب جوئی کا کیسا فقدان ہوگا۔ آج کے زمانے میں جب لوگ اپنے کسی ناپسندیدہ شخص میں وہ عیوب بھی چمٹی سے اٹھا کر ڈال دیتے ہیں، جس کا اس سے کوئی تعلق نہ ہو، ایسے میں اختر وقار جیسے فرد کو کس خانے میں رکھا جائے؟</p>\n\t\t\t<p>ہونا تو یہ چاہیے تھا کہ یہ کتاب بہت بے رس اور غیر دلچسپ ہوتی لیکن اختر نے متعدد ایسے دلچسپ واقعات لکھے ہیں جنھیں پڑھ کر ہم لطف اٹھاتے ہیں بے نظیر بھٹو کے بارے میں وہ لکھتے ہیں:</p>\n\t\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\t\t<blockquote>\" ایک دن وزیراعظم بے نظیر بھٹو اپنی تقریر کی ریکارڈنگ کے لیے آئیں تو ہمیشہ کی طرح جنرل منیجر کے کمرے میں آکر بیٹھ گئیں۔ ایک آدھ مرتبہ انھوں نے کچھ کہنا چاہا لیکن چُپ رہیں، سیکریٹری ناہید خان نے جی ایم سے کہا کہ وزیراعظم آپ سے کچھ کہنا چاہتی ہیں۔ جی ایم سمجھے کہ وہ پروگرام کے بارے میں کوئی بات کرنا چاہتی ہیں۔ انھوں نے پوچھا تو وزیراعظم کہنے لگیں \" ابھی میں نے ٹی وی سینٹر کی طرف آتے ہوئے ویگن کے اڈے پر ایک بھٹے والا بیٹھا دیکھا ہے ۔ اس سے دو بھٹے تو منگوادیں!\"</blockquote>\n\t\t\t\t<blockquote>اسی طرح اکتوبر 1999 میں جنرل پرویز مشرف نے اقتدار پر قبضے کے بعد ڈھائی بجے رات جو مختصر تقریر کی اس کا احوال اختر وقار ہمیں یوں بتاتے ہیں:</blockquote>\n\t\t\t</blockquote>\n\t\t\t<p>جنرل صاحب نے نہایت مختصر تقریر کی اور تفصیلی تقریر ایک دو دن بعد کرنے کا اعلان کیا۔ یوں پوری قوم اُس غیر یقینی صورتِ حال سے باہر نکل آئی جس میں وہ پچھلے کئی گھنٹوں سے قید تھی۔</p>\n\t\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\t\t<blockquote>تقریر کی ریکارڈنگ سے پہلے ایک دلچسپ بات یہ ہوئی کہ کافی دیر تک یہ طے نہیں ہو پایا کہ جنرل صاحب تقریر وردی میں ریکارڈ کرائیں یا عام لباس میں ۔ وجہ یہ تھی کہ سری لنکا سے واپسی میں جنرل صاحب نے سوٹ پہن رکھا تھا اور وردی کراچی اترنے پر شاید تیار نہیں تھی۔ اس لیے وہاں پہ موجود ایک کمانڈو کی قمیض پہن کر پرویز مشرف نے تقریر ریکارڈ کروائی ۔ اسی ذکر کے ساتھ ہمیں یہ بھی معلوم ہو جاتا ہے کہ 'ہنگامی حالات' کے دوران 'قوم' کو جو قومی نغمے سنائے جاتے ہیں ان کی ایک فہرست پی ٹی وی پر موجود رہتی ہے۔ ان نغموں میں اس بات کا خاص خیال رکھا جاتا ہے کہ کوئی ذو معنی مصرعہ یا شعر نشر نہ ہو جائے۔</blockquote>\n\t\t\t</blockquote>\n\t\t\t<p>اختر نے ہمیں جنرل ایوب خان اور جنرل ضیاء الحق کے بارے میں بھی سادگی سے یہ بتادیا ہے کہ یہ دونوں حضرات اپنے بارے میں کس قدر حساس اور زودرنج تھے۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>اپنی سرکاری مصروفیات کے سبب اختر کو دنیا کے بہت سے ملکوں کا سفر کرنا پڑا۔ انھوں نے کئی ملکوں کا احوال ہمیں سنایا ہے۔ جب وہ منگولیا پہنچتے ہیں تو چنگیز خان اور اس کے گھوڑے کے شاندار مجسمے کا تذکرہ اس طرح کرتے ہیں کہ جی چاہتا ہے ہم بھی اس دیس کا ایک پھیرا لگالیں۔ وہ لکھتے ہیں:</p>\n\t\t\t<blockquote>کمپلیکس کی عمارت میں ایک عجائب گھر قائم کیا گیا ہے جس میں چنگیز خان اور اس کے زمانے کی چیزیں اور یادگاریں اکھٹی کی گئی ہیں۔ عمارت چھتیس ستونوں کے سہارے کھڑی ہے۔ یہ چھتیس ستون چنگیز خان اور اس کے بعد آنے والے پنتیس منگول حکمرانوں کی نمایندگی کرتے ہیں۔عمارت کے ایک حصے میں چنگیز خان کا 131 فٹ اونچا مجسمہ بنایا گیا ہے جس میں یہ جنگجو سپہ سالار اپنی جنگی وردی میں ملبوس ایک گھوڑے پر سواریوں تیار بیٹھے دکھایا گیا ہے جیسے محاذِ جنگ پر جارہا ہے۔ یہ گھوڑا اپنی جسامت کے اعتبار سے دیکھنے سے تعلق رکھتا ہے ۔ اس کا اندازہ آپ اس بات سے لگاسکتے ہیں کہ دس بارہ لوگ ایک ساتھ گھوڑے کے سینے اور گردن سے ہوتے ہوئے اس کے سرتک پہنچتے اور دہاں کھڑے ہو کر ارد گرد کا نظارہ کرتے ہیں۔چنگیز خان اور اس کے ساتھی کس قسم کا کھانا پسند کرتے تھے اس کا اندازہ آپ اس بات سے لگا سکتے ہیں کہ پلاؤ ، کباب اور کوفتے جیسے کھانے ہم تک چنگیز خان کی فوجوں ہی کے ذریعے پہنچے تھے\"۔</blockquote>\n\t\t\t<p>\"ہم بھی وہیں موجود تھے\" میں اختر وقار عظیم نے پی ٹی وی کی نصف صدی کا قصہ لکھا ہے اور اس کے ساتھ ہی ہمیں اس دور کی جھلکیاں دکھائی ہیں جب باپ کے دوست بچوں کی تربیت کو اپنا حق جانتے تھے، جب اسلم اظہر دو ٹوک یہ پوچھ لیتے تھے کہ سول سروس میں کیوں جانا چاہتے ہو؟ کیا رشوت لینے کا خیال ہے ؟ اور جب اپنے سینئرز کے کہے ہوئے الفاظ حکم کا درجہ رکھتے تھے۔ یہ سب کچھ صدی دو صدی پرانی بات نہیں، ابھی بیس پچیس برس پہلے کا تذکرہ ہے لیکن زمانہ منقلب ہو چکا ہے۔ پہچانی ہوئی صورت بھی پہچانی نہیں جاتی۔ اختر وقار عظیم کا کرم ہے کہ انھوں نے ہمیں ان دنوں کی جھلک دکھا دی جو اب قصہ کہانی ہوگئے ۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>بشکریہ ایکسپریس</p>\n\t\t</section>\n\t</body>\n"

Findings from the Sequenced Treatments Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) emphasized the importance of measurement-based care for the treatment of depression as a key ingredient for achieving response and remission; yet measurement-based care approaches are not commonly used in clinical practice.', 'The Nine-Item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for monitoring depression severity was introduced in 19 diverse psychiatric practices. During the one-year course of the project the helpfulness and feasibility of implementation of PHQ-9 in these psychiatric practices were studied. The project was modeled after the Institute for Healthcare Improvement Breakthrough Series. Two of the 19 practices dropped out during the course of the project.', 'By the conclusion of the study, all remaining 17 practices had adopted PHQ-9 as a routine part of depression care in their practice. On the basis of responses from 17 psychiatrists from those practices, PHQ-9 scores influenced clinical decision making for 93% of 6,096 patient contacts. With the additional information gained from the PHQ-9 score, one or more treatment changes occurred during 40% of these clinical contacts. Changing the dosage of antidepressant medication and adding another medication were the most common treatment changes recorded by psychiatrists, followed by starting or increasing psychotherapy and by switching or initiating antidepressants. In 3% of the patient contacts, using the PHQ-9 led to additional suicide risk assessment.']",

The fetuses of study subjects received a VAS for three seconds and FHR changes were recorded. Fetal scalp blood pH or umbilical arterial blood pH was obtained within 15 minutes of VAS. The relationship between FHR responses to VAS and fetal blood pH in term and preterm gestations, the relationship of two tests (VAS and fetal blood pH) to type of FHR decelerations, and the predictability of neonatal morbidity by two tests were analyzed. Where appropriate, Fisher's exact test (p<0.05 was considered statistically different) and the odd ratio with 95% confidence intervals were used for statistical analyses.\", 'Excellent association between acceleration response to VAS and pH>or = 7.20, and between a negative response to VAS (no acceleration or decelerations) and pH<7.20 were found in the first stage of labor, the second stage of labor, and the combination of both stages together (p = 0.0001, OR = 10.6 [3.3-34.0]). It was observed that negative VAS responses for predicting fetal acidosis (pH<7.20) were comparable between term (>or = 37 weeks) and preterm (<37 weeks,>or = 34 weeks) fetuses. Since the preterm fetuses enrolled in the study were limited in number, it is difficult to draw adequate conclusions. The positive predictive value (PPV) of fetal acidosis was 67% in both groups of FHR variable decelerations and late decelerations, but the false negative rate of acceleration VAS response for predicting no acidosis was significantly higher in the group of late decelerations (29% vs 8%, p = 0.034). Finally, both a negative VAS response and fetal acidosis (pH<7.20) have equal predictability for neonatal morbidity. The PPV of NICU admission by a negative VAS response was two times higher than that of fetal acidosis (PPV = 61% vs 29%, p = 0.038).']",

These hospitals service an identical demographic area with the latter (NCH) a tertiary referral center. The following outcome measures were used: length of stay, appropriateness of stay, rate of admission to an in-hospital bed, and rate of unscheduled visits within 72 hours of discharge. Adverse events were reported and patient follow-up was attempted at 48 hours after discharge in all cases.\", \"The short stay ward accounted for 10.3% (Westmead Hospital) and 14.7% (New Children's Hospital) of admissions, with 56% medical in nature, 30% surgical, and the remainder procedural or psychological. Admission patterns were similar, with asthma, gastroenteritis, convulsion, pneumonia, and simple surgical conditions accounting for most short stay ward admissions. The short stay ward increased hospital efficiency with an average length of stay of 17.5 hours (Westmead Hospital) compared to 20.5 hours (New Children's Hospital). The users of the short stay ward were children of young age less than 2 years, with stay greater than 23 hours reported in only 1% of all admissions to the short stay ward. The rate of patient admission to an in-hospital bed was low, (4% [Westmead Hospital] compared to 6% [New Children's Hospital]), with the number of unscheduled visits within 72 hours of short stay ward discharge less than 1%. There were no adverse events reported at either short stay ward, with parental satisfaction high. The short stay ward was developed through reallocation of resources from within the hospital to the short stay ward.

In this study, parotid function was assessed in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancers undergoing intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with or without chemotherapy. Parotid function was assessed with the help of a questionnaire and parotid scintigraphy, especially with regards to unilateral sparing of the parotid gland.', 'In total, 19 patients were treated with compensator-based IMRT between February 2003 and March 2004. The dose to the clinical target volume ranged between 66 and 70 Gy in 30-35 fractions to 95% of the isodose volume. Ipsilateral high-risk neck nodes received an average dose of 60 Gy and the contralateral low-risk neck received a dose of 54-56 Gy. Eight of 19 patients also received concomitant chemotherapy.', 'Subjective toxicity to the parotid glands was assessed with the help of a questionnaire at 0, 3 and 6 months and objective toxicity was assessed with parotid scintigraphy at 0 and 3 months. The mean dose to the ipsilateral parotid gland ranged from 19.5 to 52.8 Gy (mean 33.14 Gy) and the mean dose to the contralateral gland was 11.1-46.6 Gy (mean 26.85 Gy).

The purpose of this study was to explore whether remote physician-examiners can replace on-site physician-examiners in an OSCE, and to determine the feasibility of this new examination method.\", 'Forty Year 3 medical students were randomised into six reOSCE stations that were incorporated into two tracks of a 10-station traditional OSCE. For the reOSCE stations, student performance was assessed by both a local examiner (LE) in the room and a remote examiner (RE) who viewed the OSCE encounters from a distance. The primary endpoint was the correlation of scores between LEs and REs across all reOSCE stations. The secondary endpoint was a post-OSCE survey of both REs and students.', 'Statistically significant correlations were found between LE and RE checklist scores for history taking (r = 0.64-r = 0.80), physical examination (r = 0.41-r = 0.54), and management stations (r = 0.78). Correlations between LE and RE global ratings were more varied (r = 0.21-r = 0.77). Correlations on three of the six stations reached significance.

The ECG, right atrial, aortic arch, and esophageal pulse pressures were measured continuously. A descending aortic occlusion balloon catheter was placed through the femoral artery. Ventricular fibrillation was induced, and no therapy was given during the 10-minute arrest time. Basic life support was then initiated and normalized by standardization of esophageal pulse pressure and central aortic blood gases. After 3 minutes of basic life support, the aortic occlusion balloon was inflated, and 0.01 mg/kg epinephrine or saline solution was administered through the aortic catheter followed by 450 mL of ultrapurified polymerized bovine hemoglobin over 2 minutes. Defibrillation was then attempted. The outcomes and changes in intravascular pressures were compared.', 'Aortic pressures were higher during infusions in animals treated with epinephrine.

However, few studies concerning the association between failure of ACL reconstruction (ACLR) and PTS have been published. The objective of this study was to explore the association between the failure of ACLR and PTS at a minimum of two years follow-up.', \"Two hundred and thirty eight eligible patients from June 2009 to October 2010 were identified from our database. A total of 20 failure cases of ACLR and 20 randomly selected controls were included in this retrospective study. The demographic data and the results of manual maximum side-to-side difference with KT-1000 arthrometer at 30° of knee flexion and pivot-shift test before the ACLR and at the final follow-up were collected. The medial and lateral PTSs were measured using the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, based on Hudek's measurement. A comparison of PTS between the two groups was performed.\", 'The overall failure rate of the present study was 8.4%. Of the 40 participants, the mean medial PTS was 4.1° ± 3.2° and the mean lateral PTS was 4.6° ± 2.6°. The medial PTS of the ACLR failure group was significantly steeper than the control group (3.5° ± 2.5° vs. 6.1° ± 2.1°, P = 0.000). Similarly, the lateral PTS of the ACLR failure group was significantly steeper than the control group (2.9° ± 2.1° vs. 5.5° ± 3.0°, P = 0.006). For medial PTS ≥ 5°, the odds ratio of ACLR failure was 6.8 (P = 0.007); for lateral PTS ≥5°, the odds ratio of ACLR failure was 10.8 (P = 0.000).']",

In addition, this longitudinal study examines the crude association between the course of neck pain and HRQoL.', 'This is a population-based cohort study.', 'Eleven hundred randomly sampled Saskatchewan adults were included.', 'Outcome measures were the mental component summary (MCS) and physical component summary (PCS) of the Short-Form-36 (SF-36) questionnaire.', 'We formed a cohort of 1,100 randomly sampled Saskatchewan adults in September 1995. We used the Chronic Pain Questionnaire to measure neck pain and its related disability. The SF-36 questionnaire was used to measure physical and mental HRQoL 6 months later. Multivariable linear regression was used to measure the association between graded neck pain and HRQoL while controlling for confounding. Analysis of variance and t tests were used to measure the crude association among four possible courses of neck pain and HRQoL at 6 months. The neck pain trajectories over 6 months were no or mild neck pain, improving neck pain, worsening neck pain, and persistent neck pain. Finally, analysis of variance was used to examine changes in baseline to 6-month PCS and MCS scores among the four neck pain trajectory groups.', 'The 6-month follow-up rate was 74.9%. We found an exposure-response relationship between neck pain and physical HRQoL after adjusting for age, education, arthritis, low back pain, and depressive symptomatology.

We ranked hospitals and used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to compare 0-30, 31-180, and 0-180-day postadmission mortality.', 'For the admissions we studied, we found a broad range of hospital performance when we ranked hospitals using the 30-day data; some hospitals had much lower than predicted 30-day mortality rates, while others had much higher than predicted mortality rates. Data from the time period 31-180 days postadmission yield results that corroborate the 0-30 day postadmission data. Moreover, we found evidence that hospital performance on one condition is related to performance on the other conditions, but that the correlation is much weaker in the 31-180-day interval than in the 0-30-day period. Using ROC curves, we found that the 30-day data discriminated the top and bottom fifths of the 180-day data extremely well, especially for AMI outcomes.']",

Patients with platelet count ≤ 205 had a significantly better 5-year survival than patients with a platelet count>205 (60.7 vs. 31.6 %, P<0.001). The 5-year survival of patients either with platelet count ≤ 205 or>205 were similar (68.6 vs. 58.8 %, P = 0.085) when the nodes were negative. However, the 5-year survival of patients with platelet count ≤ 205 was better than that of patients with a platelet count>205 when the nodes were involved (32.0 vs. 12.7 %, P = 0.004).

The Ki-67 antigen is a classic marker of cellular proliferation, but there is still controversy regarding the significance and importance of Ki-67 in tumor progression.', 'In this study, we first detected Ki-67 expression in UTUC patients by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Subsequently, we quantitatively combined the results with those from the published literature in a meta-analysis after searching several databases.', 'IHC results demonstrated that patients with muscle-invasive tumors (T2-T4) had higher Ki-67 expression than those with non-muscle-invasive tumors (Tis-T1), suggesting that high Ki-67 expression may be associated with the aggressive form of UTUC. Kaplan-Meier curves showed that patients with high Ki-67 expression had significantly poorer cancer-specific survival (CSS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Furthermore, multivariate analysis suggested that Ki-67 expression was an independent prognostic factor for CSS (hazard ratio, HR=3.196) and DFS (HR=3.517) in UTUC patients. Then, a meta-analysis of the published literature investigating Ki-67 expression and its effects on UTUC prognosis was conducted. After searching the PubMed, Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library and Scopus databases, 12 articles met the eligibility criteria for this analysis. The eligible studies included a total of 1740 patients with a mean number of 82 patients per study (range, 38-475). The combined results showed that increased Ki-67 levels were associated with poor survival and disease progression, with a pooled HR estimate of 2.081 and 2.791, respectively. In subgroup analysis, the pooled HR was statistically significant for cancer-specific survival (HR=2.276), metastasis-free survival (HR=3.008) and disease-free survival (HR=6.336).']",

Neuropsychological testing procedures have been shown to be sensitive in measuring cognitive sequelae of mild traumatic brain injury (concussion) in athletes. The failure of this study to find any relationship between LOC and neuropsychological functioning in a large sample of patients with mild head trauma calls into question the assignment of primary importance to LOC in grading severity of concussion. This study also does not provide support for the use of guidelines that rely heavily on LOC in making return-to-play decisions.

Past fentanyl access was primarily oral or dermal via prescription fentanyl patch diversion. One factor potentially driving this increase in fatalities is the change in route of administration. Rapid intravenous (IV) fentanyl can produce chest wall rigidity. We evaluated post-mortem fentanyl and norfentanyl concentrations in a recent surge of lethal fentanyl intoxications.', \"Fentanyl related deaths from the Franklin County coroner's office from January to September 2015 were identified. Presumptive positive fentanyl results were confirmed by quantitative analysis using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) and were able to quantify fentanyl, norfentanyl, alfentanyl, and sufentanyl.\", '48 fentanyl deaths were identified. Mean fentanyl concentrations were 12.5\\u2009ng/ml, (range 0.5\\u2009ng/ml to\\u2009>40\\u2009ng/ml). Mean norfentanyl concentrations were 1.9\\u2009ng/ml (range none detected to 8.3\\u2009ng/ml). No appreciable concentrations of norfentanyl could be detected in 20 of 48 cases (42%) and were less than 1\\u2009ng/ml in 25 cases (52%). Elevated fentanyl concentrations did not correlate with rises in norfentanyl levels. In several cases fentanyl concentrations were strikingly high (22\\u2009ng/ml and 20\\u2009ng/ml) with no norfentanyl detected.', 'The lack of any measurable norfentanyl in half of our cases suggests a very rapid death, consistent with acute chest rigidity. An alternate explanation could be a dose-related rapid onset of respiratory arrest. Deaths occurred with low levels of fentanyl in the therapeutic range (1-2\\u2009ng/ml) in apparent non-naïve opiate abusers. Acute chest wall rigidity is a well-recognized complication in the medical community but unknown within the drug abuse community.

Chest wall rigidity may help explain the cause of death in these instances, in contrast to the typical opioid-related overdose deaths.

Джеймс Фюлер обсъжда своето изследване за разработване на антитела срещу болестта на Алцхаймер в третата и много коментирана статия за наградата за научни публикации Макс Перуц за 2012.  Представете си, че живеете с мисълта, че през следващото десетилетие мозъкът ви ще бъде унищожен от собственото ви тяло. След като невроните бъдат изгасени като свещи, какво ще загубите после? Дали ще са скъпи спомени? Способността да извършвате ежедневни задачи? Може би част от вашата индивидуалност? Вашето семейство и приятели ще трябва да гледат безпомощно, докато човека, когото обичат бавно изчезва.  Представете си, че разберете, че с всичкото ни медицинско познание ние не можем да направим нищо. Нито едно лечение не може да забави хода на това заболяване. Това е реалността за всеки с диагноза деменция.  Болестта на Алцхаймер е най-често срещаната форма на деменция с около 20 милиона страдащи по света, изискващи 400 милиарда паунда разходи за здравни услуги. Тези числа вече са плашещи, но населението застарява и броя на хората с деменция ще се удвои през следващите 30 години. Единствения начин да предотвратим това е да разработим нови лекарства за борба с това опустошително състояние. Сегашните лечения работят като увеличават определени химикали в мозъка, позволявайки на невроните да функционират, но не спират умирането им. Въпреки многото изследвания и опити на потенциални лекарства, не е открито нито едно лечение, което да забави скоростта на умиране на невроните.  И така, какво ни спира да разработим тези нови лечения? Съществуват много проблеми, но може би най-големия е, че не разбираме напълно как работи тази болест и как да направим модел на болестта в лаборатория. Това може да е причината за провала на толкова много лекарства при клиничните изследвания - ясно е, че имаме нужда от нови подходи. Като се вгледаме в кръвта или мозъка на пациентите можем да разберем какво се разваля от болестта на Алцхаймер и следователно да създадем нови потенциални лечения.  От тези изследвания знаем, че протеин наречен Aß (амилоид-бета) по незнайни причини се натрупва в мозъка на пациентите с Алцхаймер, формирайки големи бучки наречени плаки. Една идея предполага, че натрупването на тези плаки причинява разрушаването на невроните и затова премахването на тези плаки може да защити невроните от умиране. В резултат на това наблюдение са разработени лечения за разбиването на тези бучки и намаляване на количеството на произвеждания Aß.  Една от най-ефективните и революционни идеи е да се \"ваксинират\" пациентите с Алцхаймер срещу тези плаки. Това е много подобно на процеса, който протича, когато ви ваксинират срещу болести като туберкулоза. Ваксината срещу туберкулоза учи имунната ви система да разпознава и запомни мъртвата форма на бактерията, която причинява болестта.  Това означава, че когато се сблъскате с истинската бактерия имунните клетки могат да се борят с инфекцията. По време на този процес се създават антитела, които се свързват с бактерията, и след това се активира имунната система, която поглъща и унищожава покритата с антитела бактерия, предпазвайки ви от разболяване.   Сега е момента да се запитате какво общо има това с болестта на Алцхаймер.  Учените могат да произведат антитела в лаборатория, които да се свързват с почти всичко - вирус, ракова клетка и дори плаките, които намираме в мозъците на пациентите с Алцхаймер. Кагото пациент с Алцхаймер е лекуван с антитела, които се свързват с плаките, тези бучки се покриват с антитела. Последващия имунен отговор изчиства мозъка на пациента от тези потенциално опасни плаки.  Чудесно, значи можем да използваме тези антитела да помогнем на пациентите? Е, не съвсем - докато антителата чистят ефективно плаките от мозъка, успеха се помрачава от страничните ефекти. За да се премахнат плаките покрити с антитела е нужно да се активират клетки от имунната система и това може да причини възпаление на мозъка. Докато възпалението всъщност е полезно при премахването на бактерии като туберкулозната, възпалението на мозъка може да има тежки последици.  Възпалението при пациентите с Алцхаймер се случва около кръвоносните съдове в мозъка и причинява увреждане и кръвоизливи, потенциално причинявайки допълнително влошаване и загуба на паметта. За своята докторска теза разработвам нови антитела, за предотвратяване на тези лоши странични ефекти. Чрез нищожни промени в структурата на антителата можем да контролираме как имунната система реагира на лечението. Надяваме се тези нови антитела да премахват плаките, без да причиняват допълнително увреждане на мозъка.  Напредъка в здравеопазването увеличи с много продължителността на живота ни, обаче качеството на живот, което изпитваме в нашите старчески години, не се увеличава със същите темпове. Деменцията е едно от най-големите предизвикателства пред науката и проблемът ще се влошава ако нови лечения не се намерят скоро. Впрягането на силата на имунната система чрез антителата може да е едно от тези лечения, а това вече е ефективна стратегия при лечението на бактериални инфекции, рак и ревматоиден артрит. Ако можем да направим тази форма на лечение безопасна за третиране на болестта на Алцхаймер, това може да е стъпка напред към намаляването на страданието на милиони пациенти по света.\n\t\t\t",

ہے۔ انھوں نے زندگی طویل پائی مگر مقابلۃً کم لکھا تاہم جتنا لکھا اس پر ”قدرِ اول“ کی مہر ثبت کیے بغیر چارہ نہیں۔ ان کی تحریری تگ و تاز کا اصل میدان تاریخی و تقابلی لسانیات تھا اور اس باب میں ان کے علمی حاصلات ایک مدت تک اہلِ نظر سے خراجِ توصیف وصول کرتے رہیں گے۔ انھوں نے تاریخ کو تحقیق سے مربوط کیا۔ ان کا تحقیقی طریقِ کار گہرا تعقلاتی تھا، جذبات اور جذباتیت سے خالی اور خالصتہً علمی۔ تاریخی لسانیات پر ان کی نظر قابلِ رشک تھی۔ وہ عربی، فارسی، ہندی، پہلوی، سنسکرت اور انگریزی سے گہری آگاہی رکھتے تھے۔ علاوہ ازیں عبرانی، سریانی اور ترکی سے بھی کسی قدر واقفیت بہم پہنچائی۔ ارد و، فارسی اور عربی کے لسانی امور ہی نہیں، ان زبانوں کے ادبیات سے بھی بخوبی آگاہ تھے۔ دراصل عبدالستار صدیقی کے پاے کے علما اردو میں شاذ کے حکم میں داخل ہیں۔ مقالات صدیقی (پہلا حصہ)، معرّباتِ رشیدی (ترتیب) اور دیگر متعدد تحریروں کے مطالعے سے اندازہ ہوتا ہے کہ عبدالستار صدیقی کو لفظوں کی عہد بہ عہد موجودگی اور ان کے اوضاع و تغیرات، فرہنگوں کی صحت و سقم، اپنی مخصوص علمی و لسانی اقلیم میں ہر دور کے لفظی و لسانی نظائر اور وضعِ اصطلاحات کے بصیرت افروز نکتوں کا کیسا گہرا شعور تھا۔ ان کے بعض مقالات لسانی معلومات کی کان ہیں۔ ان کے معاصرین میں یہ لسانی ذوق اور گہرا لسانی شعور حافظ محمود شیرانی، وحید الدین سلیم، سید سلیمان ندوی، احمد دین، مولانا سلیمان اشرف، پنڈت کیفی، شوکت سبزواری اور چند ہی اور انے گنے لوگوں میں تھا۔ پیشروؤں میں اس کی مثالیں سراج الدین آرزوؔ، انشا اللہ خاں انشاؔ اور محمد حسین آزادؔ کی صورت میں نظر آتی ہیں۔ تقابلی لسانیات کے اولیں شواہد برعظیم میں آرزوؔ اور انشاؔ ہی کے ہاں ملتے ہیں۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>عبدالستار صدیقی کے معاصرین مثلاً حافظ محمود شیرانی، سید سلیمان ندوی، عبدالماجد دریا بادی اور متعدد دیگر حضرات ان کی لسانی خدمات اور اس باب میں ان کے تبحّر کا لوہا مانتے تھے۔ سید سلیمان ندوی نے معارف کے مارچ ۱۹۳۰ئ کے شمارے میں ان کے بارے میں بالکل درست لکھا تھا:</p>\n\t\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\t\t<p>موصوف ہندوستان کے موجودہ مغربی سند یافتگانِ السنۂ شرقیہ میں ممتاز درجہ رکھتے ہیں اور خصوصیت کے ساتھ عربی زبان کے فقہ اللغہ (فیلالوجی) اور عربی اور سامی اور فارسی زبانوں کے باہمی تعلقات پر ان کو عبورِ کامل ہے۔</p>\n\t\t\t</blockquote>\n\t\t\t<p>چونکہ عبدالستار صدیقی نے اپنی متعدد انتظامی مصروفیات اور طلبہ و احباب کی علمی رہنمائی اور معاونت میں وقت کے کثیر حصے کے صرف کے باعث کم لکھا، اسی لیے ایک دوسرے موقع پر جب سید سلیمان ندوی نے ۱۹۳۹ئ میںمعارف اورہندستانی میں ”بعض پرانے لفظوں کی نئی تحقیق اور تہنید“ کے زیر عنوان دو قسطیں شائع کیں اور صدیقی صاحب نے ان پر استدراک رقم کیا تو سید صاحب نے دلچسپ انداز میں لکھا:</p>\n\t\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\t\t<p>علم میں خیّام کی طرح بخیل ہیں اور قلم کو بہت کم حرکت دیتے ہیں۔</p>\n\t\t\t</blockquote>\n\t\t\t<p>صدیقی صاحب نے سید سلیمان ندوی کے مذکورہ مقالے پر استدراک ہی نہیں لکھا، سید صاحب سے اختلاف کرتے ہوئے ان کے نام ایک دلچسپ خط میں ان کے اس خیال سے اختلاف بھی کیا کہ ایک زبان میں درآنے والے دخیل الفاظ کو اُس زبان کے برتنے والے ”بگاڑ“ دیتے ہیں۔ لکھتے ہیں:</p>\n\t\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\t\t<p>میں دل سے ڈرتا ہوں کہ کہیں آپ برا نہ مان جائیں مگر زبان کم بخت مانتی نہیں۔ ”بوتام“ ہمارا بڑا اچھا لفظ ہے، اسے ”بگاڑ“ کہنا تو کجا میں سُن نہیں سکتا۔ ہم جس لفظ کو اپنی زبان میں لیتے ہیں، اپنی زبان کی ضرورتوں کو مدنظر رکھتے ہوئے اسے ”بناتے“ ہیں یعنی ہماری زبان اسے اپنے ڈھب کا بنا لیتی ہے۔ اسے بگاڑنا کیونکر کہیے گا؟ اور ”بوتام“ میں تو یہ بھی نہیں۔ جس زمانے میں فرانسیسی ہندستان آئے، ان کی زبان سے پہلے پہلے (شاید ہندستانی سپاہیوں نے) بُوتون سنا۔ ’بٹن‘ بہت بعد کو انگریز لوگ لائے۔ اسی طرح ایک اور لفظ ہے ”کارتوس“، انگریزی میں ”کارٹ رِج“ اس سے ہمارا ”کارتوس“ ہرگز نہیں بنا۔ فرانسیسیوں سے ”کارتوش“ سن کر ہمارے سپاہیوں نے ”کارتوس“ تلفظ کیا۔ جیسے ”دیش“ سے ”دیس“ ہوا، ”کارتوش“ سے کارتوس ہوا۔ انگریز ”کمانڈانٹ“ بولتا ہے۔ اس کو فرانسیسی ”کوماں داں“ بولتا ہے۔ ”کمیدان“ کہا تو ہم نے اس کا کیا بگاڑا؟</p>\n\t\t\t</blockquote>\n\t\t\t<p>آپ نے ملاحظہ فرمایا کہ ایک منجھے ہوئے ماہرلسانیات نے کتنے اہم لسانی اصول کی نشان دہی کیسے سلیقے اور کس علمی شان سے کی۔ اس اقتباس سے خوب اندازہ ہوتا ہے کہ صدیقی صاحب تاریخی اور تقابلی لسانیات پر کیسی اچھی نظر رکھتے تھے۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>تاریخی اور تقابلی لسانیات سے صدیقی صاحب کی اطمینان بخش بلکہ حیران کن آگاہی کے شواہد مقالاتِ صدیقی اور متعدد دیگر تحریروں میں قدم قدم پر نظر آتے ہیں۔ دخیل الفاظ کے موضوع سے انھیں خصوصی دلچسپی تھی۔ ۱۹۱۲ئ سے ۱۹۱۹ئ تک کم و بیش سات برس انھوں نے یورپ اور خصوصاً جرمنی میں گزارے تھے اورکلاسیکی عربی میں فارسی کے مستعار (دخیل) الفاظ کے زیر عنوان جرمن زبان میں ڈاکٹریٹ کا مقالہ لکھا تھا جو ۱۹۱۹ئ ہی میں جرمنی سے شائع ہوا تھا۔ اپنی اس کتاب اور بعض دیگر اہم تحریروں کا ذکر کرتے ہوئے مولانا امتیاز علی عرشی کے نام ۲۵ اپریل ۱۹۴۴ئ کے ایک خط میں لکھتے ہیں:</p>\n\t\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\t\t<p>۱۹۱۹ئ میں میری کتاب جرمانی زبان میں (جرمانیا کے شہر گوئِ ٹنگن سے) شائع ہوئی تھی۔ اس کا نام انگریزی زبان میں ترجمہ کر کے لکھتا ہوں: <annotation lang=\"en\">Studies in Persian Loan-words in Classical Arabic</annotation>۔ اس میں ان فارسی الاصل لفظوں پر بحث ہے جو جاہلیت کے زمانے سے لے کر اسلام کے ابتدائی زمانے تک فارسی سے عربی میں داخل ہو چکے تھے۔ اس مقالے میں فرداً فرداً لفظوں سے بحث نہیں کی گئی بلکہ تعریب وغیرہ کے اصول سے بحث ہے۔۔۔ اگر آپ وہ بڑودے والی کتاب میرے لیے بھیج دیںتو ضرور آرامی اور عبرانی وغیرہ لفظوں کا تلفظ لکھ بھیجوں گا۔ وہ جرمانی کتاب آپ کو دیکھنے کو بھیج دیتا لیکن وہ آپ کے کس کام کی؟ ۱۹۳۰ئ میں ایک مقالہ ابنِ دُرَید اور اس کے معرّبات پر شائع کیا تھا۔ اس کا ایک نسخہ بھیجتا ہوں۔۔۔ اُسی سال مولوی سید سلیمان اشرف مرحوم کی کتاب المبین پر میں نے ایک تبصرہ رسالہ معارف میں لکھا تھا۔ اس کے کچھ نسخے الگ بھی چھپ گئے تھے جو بٹ گئے۔ یہ نسخہ اس خیال سے آپ کو بھیجتا ہوں کہ شاید معارف کی جلدوں میں ڈھونڈنا زحمت کا باعث ہو۔۔۔</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>عربی مبین پر حرف آنے کا طوفان ہمارے بزرگوں ہی نے اٹھایا تھا۔ اگرچہ اسی زمانے میں بعضے محققوں نے اس کی تردید کر دی تھی مگر وہ بات جو مذہبی عصبیت کی لَے میں ایک بار کہہ دی گئی تھی، لوگوں کے دلوں میں جم گئی۔ اُس کی تردید کو کوئی سمجھا کوئی نہ سمجھا۔</p>\n\t\t\t</blockquote>\n\t\t\t<p>یہ درست ہے کہ صدیقی صاحب نے زندگی میں کم نویسی کو اپنا شعار بنائے رکھا مگر بدقسمتی یہ ہے کہ جو لکھا ان تحریروں کی بھی صرف ایک جلد اب تک منظر عام پر آسکی حال آں کہ بقول مرتب مقالات کی تعداد اتنی تھی کہ دو مزید جلدیں شائع ہو سکتی تھیں مگر نہ ہوسکیں۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>زیرِ نظر مقالے میں ان کے مضامین کی جلد اول اور بعض دیگر مقالوں سے، جو رسائل و جرائد سے حاصل ہو سکے، اعتنا کیا گیا ہے۔ ان تحریروں سے صدیقی صاحب کی گہری نظر اور غیرمعمولی تعمّق و تبحرّ کا بہ سہولت اندازہ ہوتا ہے۔ ان تحریروں میں اگر مشاہیر کے نام ان کے علمی مکتوبات بھی شامل کر لیے جائیں تو ان کے علم و فضل کی زیادہ مکمل تصویر سامنے آتی ہے۔ سو میں نے ان کے غیرمعمولی علمی مقام کے تعیّن میں ان مکتوبات سے بھی جابجا مدد لی ہے۔ حق یہ ہے کہ رشید حسن خاں نے اگر عبدالستار صدیقی کو ”اساطینِ ادب“ میں شمار کیا ہے تو کسی مبالغے سے کام نہیں لیا اور اگر ڈاکٹر سید عبداللہ نے لکھا ہے کہ ان کے بے مثال علمی و لسانی مباحث کے حامل مکتوبات پڑھ کر اصمعی، ابنِ سلّام، ابنِ سیدہ اور ابنِ دُرَید کی یاد تازہ ہو جاتی ہے، تو ایک بدیہی صداقت کے سوا کچھ نہیں۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>مقالاتِ صدیقی میں صدیقی صاحب کی ۱۹۱۰ئ سے لے کر ۱۹۶۱ئ تک کی تحریروں کا احاطہ کیا گیا ہے۔ یہ جلد زیادہ تر لسانی مباحث پر مشتمل ہے مگر اس میں ایسے ایسے چشم کشا لسانی موضوعات کو زیربحث لایا گیا ہے کہ اُن کی داد نہ دینا ظلم ہوگا۔ ہندوستان بغیر واؤ کے، بغداد کی وجہِ تسمیہ، لفظ سُغد کی تحقیق، ذال معجمہ فارسی میں، ولیؔ کی زبان، اردو املا، بعض پرانے لفظوں کی نئی تحقیق اور ان کے علاوہ افسوس (لفظ کا ایک بھولا ہوا مفہوم) معرّب لفظوں میں حرف ”ق“ کی حیثیت، تماہی کی ترکیب، وضع اصطلاحات پر تبصرہ اور معائبِ سخن کلامِ حافظؔ کے آئینے میں وغیرہ کے مطالعے سے صدیقی صاحب ایک ایسے عالم لسانیات کی حیثیت سے سامنے آتے ہیں جو شاید لفظ و لغات سے ہمہ وقت محوِ مکالمہ رہتے ہوں اور انھی سے ربط و ضبط کو اپنا حاصلِ حیات سمجھتے ہوں۔ تماہی کی ترکیب کو درست ثابت کرنے کے لیے وہ اردو میں مستعمل ایسے لفظوں کا انبار لگا دیتے ہیں جو ایسی ہی تراکیب کے مماثل ہیں یعنی ایسی ترکیبیں جن میں ہندی اور فارسی یا عربی الفاظ کو مرکبات کی صورت میں ڈھالا گیا ہے۔ ”بارہ دری“، ”بارہ گزی“، ”تیس ہزاری باغ“، تپائی، تراہا، دوغزلا، تغزلا، ست خصمی، چھ ماہی، دُفصلا (جو درخت سال میں دو بار پھلتا ہے) وغیرہ وغیرہ۔ اس ساری بحث میں صدیقی صاحب کا طریق کار ایک بردبار اور حلیم الطبع عالم کا ہے جو بغیر کسی جھنجھلاہٹ یا خشونَت کے بڑی نرمی لیکن کمال ثبات کے ساتھ دلیلوں پر دلیلیں دیے چلا جاتا ہے۔ ان کے نزدیک اردو کے مجتہد فصیحوں نے نہایت بے تکلفی اور بے باکی سے فارسی اردو اجزا کو باہم ملایا ہے مثلاً سوداؔ نے برفاب، غرقاب کے وزن پر ”چھڑکاب“ بنا لیا۔ صدیقی نے اسے سندِ ثقاہت عطا کر دی۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>تاریخی لسانیات سے صدیقی صاحب کے لگاؤ کے شواہدان کی تحریروں میں جابجا نظر آتے ہیں۔ ان کے مقالے ”ہندوستان بغیر واؤ کے صحیح ہے“ کے مطالعے سے یہ امر بڑی صراحت سے آئینہ ہو جاتا ہے کہ ”ہندوستان“ کے مقابلے میں ”ہندستان“ (بغیر واؤ) کے زیادہ رائج رہا ہے۔ ایران کے متقدم شعرا ابوالفرج رونیؔ، مسعود سعد سلمان، فرخیؔ، عثمان مختاری، نظامیؔ اور رومیؔ وغیرہ سے لے کر متاخّر شعرا مثلاً جامیؔ تک کے یہاں ”ہندستان“ ہی مستعمل رہا ہے۔ پھر فرہنگِ انجمن آراے جہانگیری میں رضا قلی خاں ہدایت نے ”ہندستان“ ہی کو مستقل لفظ کی حیثیت میں جگہ دی ہے۔ ڈاکٹر صدیقی بے شمار مثالوں سے ثابت کرتے ہیں کہ لفظ ”ہندستان“ کی وہی حیثیت ہے جو بغداد (باغِ داد)، پرستان (پری ستان)، دشمن (دشت من)، دشنام (دشت نام) اور ناخدا (ناوخدا) وغیرہ کی تھی۔ پھر معاملہ محض فارسی زبان تک نہیں رہا، عربی اور ترکی میں بھی ’ہندستان‘ بغیر واو کے مستعمل رہا ہے۔ خود اردو شاعری میں وجہیؔ، ولیؔ، سوداؔ، میرؔ، آتشؔ، مصحفیؔ، ناسخؔ، جرأتؔ، قدرؔ بلگرامی، اِسماعیلؔ میرٹھی وغیرہ کے یہاں ”ہندستان“ ہی مستعمل رہا ہے۔ میرے خیال میں بعض مستثنیات بھی ہیں جن کی طرف صدیقی صاحب نے اشارہ نہیں کیا مثلاً مصحفیؔ کا یہ مشہورشعر کیسے نظر اندازکیا جاسکتا ہے:</p>\n\t\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\t\t<verse>\n\t\t\t\t\tہندوستاں کی دولت و حشمت جو کچھ کہ تھی\n\t\t\t\t\tظالم فرنگیوں نے بہ تدبیر کھینچ لی!\n\t\t\t\t</verse>\n\t\t\t</blockquote>\n\t\t\t<p>بہرحال صدیقی صاحب کے نزدیک فصحا کی زبان پر ”ہندستان“ اور ”ہندستانی“ ہی ہے اور یہی قابلِ ترجیح ہے۔ اس کے باوجود صدیقی صاحب ہندوستان اور ہندوستانی کو بھی غلط نہیں کہتے اور یہ ان کی سلامتیِ طبع کی دلیل ہے۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>س مقالے میں ایک مقام پر صدیقی صاحب نے لکھا ہے کہ ”ہندستان“ کی مزید تخفیف ”ہندساں“ کی صورت میں بھی ملتی ہے۔ وہ اس ضمن میں فرہنگِ جہانگیری اور بہارِ عجم کی عبارتیں نقل کرتے ہیں جہاں ”ہندوستان“ کی ایک شکل ”ہندستاں“ نقل ہوئی ہے مگر وہاں فرّخی کا جو شعر درج ہوا ہے اس میں ”ہندستاں“ کے بجاے ”ہندساں“ ہے، شعر یہ ہے</p>\n\t\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\t\t<verse>\n\t\t\t\t\tگر ز جُودِ تو نسیمی بگذرد بر زنگبار!\n\t\t\t\t\tور ز خشم تو سمومی دروزد بر ہندساں\n\t\t\t\t</verse>\n\t\t\t</blockquote>\n\t\t\t<p>چونکہ دونو فرہنگوں کی نثری عبارت اور شعر میں مستعمل نظیروں (ہندستاں/ ہندساں) میں فرق ہے لہٰذا اب برہانِ قاطعسے سند لاتے ہیں جہاں لکھا ہے: ”ہندساں“ باسینِ بے نقطہ بروزنِ ہندواں“۔۔۔ پھر لکھتے ہیں کہ برہانِ قاطع کی اس تشریح سے جہانگیری اوربہار کی عبارتیں صاف ہو گئیں اور ”اب پورے یقین کے ساتھ کہا جاسکتا ہے کہ استاد فرّخیؔ کے شعر میں ’ہندساں‘ ہی ہے ’ہندستاں‘ نہیں۔ ’ہندساں‘ شاعروں کے کلام میں زیادہ نہیں ملتا مگر اس کا تو یقین ہو گیا کہ چوتھی صدی ہجری میں ”ہندساں“ زبان میں داخل ہو چکا تھا (مقالات صدیقی ص۴۱)۔ اس مختصر عبارت سے جہاں اس امر کا اندازہ ہوتا ہے کہ صدیقی صاحب لفظوں کے عہد بہ عہد متغیر اوضاع پر غیرمعمولی نظر رکھتے تھے وہاں اس عبارت پر تھوڑی سی حیرت بھی ہوئی: ”اب پورے یقین سے کہا جاسکتا ہے کہ استاد فرّخیؔ کے شعر میں ”ہندساں“ ہی ہے ’ہندستاں‘ نہیں“۔ حیرت اس امر پر ہے کہ عروض اور معاملاتِ عروض پر گہری نظر رکھنے والے محقق کو یہ لکھنے کی ضرورت ہی کیوں پیش آئی۔ فرّخیؔ کا شعر جس بحر میں (فاعلاتن فاعلاتن فاعلاتن فاعلات =رمل مثمن مقصور/ محذوف)ہے، اس میں ’ہندستاں‘ سماہی نہیں سکتا۔ وہاں تو ”فاعلات“ کے وزن پر کوئی لفظ ہی آسکتا تھا اور وہ ”ہندساں“ کے سوا اور کیا ہو سکتا تھا، اس لیے بھی کہ زنگبار اور ہندساں میں رعایت معنوی ہے کہ دونوں میں ”سیاہی“ کا عنصر موجود ہے۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>اوپر ذکر ہوا کہ صدیقی لفظوں کے عہد بہ عہد متغیر اوضاع پر غیر معمولی نظر رکھتے تھے۔ اس کے شواہدان کے مقالات اور دیگر تحریروں میں جگہ جگہ ملتے ہیں مثلاً ”بغداد“ کی وجہ تسمیہ “نامی معروف مضمون میں بغداد کے ایک توضیحی مترادف ”باغ داد” کے ضمن میں بتاتے ہیں کہ بعض کے خیال میں ”بغ“ کے معنی بستاں کے ہیں اور داد“ عطا کیا۔ چونکہ کسریٰ (ساسانی بادشاہ) نے یہ باغ ایک خواجہ سرا کو دے دیا تھا لہٰذا ”بغ داد“ کہلایا۔ پھرداد تحقیق دیتے ہوئے لکھتے ہیں:</p>\n\t\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\t\t<p>اگر یوں لیجیے تو پھر اس باغ کا نام ’باغِ دادہ‘ ہونا چاہیے تھا مگر ’دادہ‘ کی صورت ساسانی عہد کی زبان میں ’داذک‘ یا ’دازگ‘ تھی۔ یہ معرّب ہو کر (اگر پہلے الف کا حذف ہو جانا بھی مان لیا جائے تو) \n\t\t\t\t’بغداذق‘ یا ’بغداذخ‘ ہو گیا ہوتا جیسے ”بَیذق“ اور ”ساذج“ اور موجودہ فارسی میں ”بغدادہ“ ہوتا مگر ان صورتوں میں سے ایک بھی نہیں ملتی۔</p>\n\t\t\t</blockquote>\n\t\t\t<p>اسی مقالے میں آگے چل کر ”باغ داد“ یا ”باغِ داد“ کی تخئیلی اڑان کو رد کرتے ہوئے صدیقی بغداد کے پہلے حصے ”بغ“ کی معنویت اجاگر کرتے ہیں اور بتاتے ہیں کہ اس کی صورت اوِستا میں بَغَ اور بَگَ، میخی کتبوں میں بَغَ ہے اور اس کے معنی خدا/ دیوتا کے ہیں۔ ان کے خیال میں سنسکرت کے بھگوان یا بھگوت وغیرہ کا پہلا جز ”بھگ“ اور ”بَغ“ ایک ہی لفظ ہے۔ ایران میں یہ لفظ زردشتیت سے پہلے موجود تھا جب وہاں بتوں کی پوجا ہوتی تھی۔ اسی طرح چند صفحات کے بعد صدیقی صاحب نے ”بے ستون“ کے ضمن میں تاریخی لسانیات کی روایت کو کام میں لاتے ہوئے جس گہرائی کے ساتھ اس کے اجزا کی مختلف وضعوں کی توضیح کی ہے، اس کی کیفیت لفظوں میں بیان نہیں ہو سکتی۔ بس، آبگینہ تندیِ صہبا سے پگھلا جائے ہے، کی صورت ہے۔ مقالے کے آخر میں صدیقی صاحب نے اس حقیقت سے بھی پردہ اٹھایا ہے کہ اسما و القاب کی کس طرح اپنی نہاد میں کسی عقیدے، ایقان یا اعتقاد کو چھپائے ہوتے ہیں جن تک نگاہ گہرے لسانی تاریخی شعور کے بغیر نہیں پہنچ پاتی۔ فغفور (بغپور) فَغ= خدا، دیوتا، پور = بیٹا، کی وضاحت کرتے ہوئے انھوں نے جو کچھ لکھا ہے اس سے اندازہ ہوتا ہے کہ تاریخی اور تقابلی لسانیات بہت سے قدیم مذہبی و معتقداتی تصورات کی بھی پردہ کشا ہے۔ لکھتے ہیں:</p>\n\t\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\t\t<p>”بغپور“ چبن کے شہزادوں کا لقب ہرگز نہ تھا۔۔۔ چین کے بادشاہ کو کہتے تھے اور اسے ویسا ہی استعارہ سمجھنا چاہیے جیسا ”ظل اللہ“ میں ہے۔ بادشاہ کے ربّانی حقوق کو پورب ہی نہیں پچھّم کی قومیں بھی آج سے چند ہی صدی پہلے تک مانتی رہی تھیں۔ خوارزمی کا خیال ادھر نہیں گیا، نہیں تو یہ فقرہ مفاتیح العلوم میں جگہ نہ پاتا: وَلَعَلّ بغدادُ ھی عَطِیّۃ الملِک(اور شاید بغداد سے مراد ہو: بادشاہ کا عطیہ)۔</p>\n\t\t\t</blockquote>\n\t\t\t<p>دراصل لسانیات کی باقاعدہ سالہا سال کی تحصیل، ایک مدت کے تعمق اور مشرقی زبانوں اور ان کے ادبیات کے ساتھ گہری فکری و ذہنی وابستگی نے صدیقی صاحب کو غیرمعمولی لسانی بصیرت عطا کی تھی۔ یہی وجہ ہے کہ وہ سطحی لسانی یا صوتی تماثلات کو بے اصولی گردانتے تھے۔ ان کا بالکل صحیح موقف تھا کہ لسانیات کی حالت اور حیثیت ریاضیات کی سی ہے۔ مختارالدین احمد کے نام اپنے ایک خط میں نہایت پتے کی باتیں کرتے ہوئے لکھتے ہیں:</p>\n\t\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\t\t<p>آپ کو یہ سمجھ لینا چاہیے کہ چند آوازوں اور ان کے مجموعوں (لفظوں) کو جان لینا اور بغیر کسی ترتیب اور نظام کے لکھ دینا لسانیات سے بہت دور ہے۔ لسانیات ایک <annotation lang=\"en\">Accurate Science</annotation> ہے۔</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>۲- لسانی بحث کے لیے نہایت ضروری ہے کہ آپ لفظوں کی تاریخ معلوم کریں اور ہر قدم پر یہ دیکھیں کہ میں کچھ تاریخ کے خلاف تو نہیں کہہ رہا ہوں۔</p>\n\t\t\t</blockquote>\n\t\t\t<p>یہ فہمائش صدیقی صاحب کو اس لیے کرنا پڑی تھی کہ مختارالدین احمد نے اپنے ایک مضمون میں بعض انگریزی اور عربی لفظوں کی مماثلت دکھائی تھی۔ انھوں نے نہ صرف <annotation lang=\"en\">Navel</annotation> کو ناف سے جاملایا تھا بلکہ ناف کو عربی قرار دے ڈالا تھا۔ چنانچہ صدیقی صاحب کو وضاحت کرنا پڑی کہ ”ناف“ عربی نہیں فارسی ہے۔ عربی میں اسے ”سرہ“ کہتے ہیں۔ انھوں نے اس طرح کی بے جوڑ لسانی مماثلتوں کو ”انتقال“ اور ”انت کال“ کی سی لسانی بوالعجبی قرار دیا تھا۔ ان کے خیال میں آریائی اور سامی زبانوں کو آپس میں جوڑنا سعیِ لاحاصل ہے۔ دلچسپ اور اہم بات یہ ہے کہ صدیقی صاحب کے اس موقف کی تائید ان کے سینئر معاصر احمد دین کی سرگذشتِ الفاظسے بھی ہوتی ہے۔ واضح رہے کہ احمد دین کی مذکورہ کتاب پہلی بار ۱۹۲۳ئ میں شائع ہوئی تھی۔ احمد دین نے لکھا تھا:</p>\n\t\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\t\t<p>انتقال عربی الاصل ہے، نقل سے مشتق ہے۔ اسے سنسکرت انتسا (موت) اور کال (وقت) سے ملانا بے جوڑ بات ہے۔ اسی طرح ”انتہا“ بھی عربی ہے، سنسکرت ”ان تھاہ“ یعنی جس کی تھاہ نہ ملے، بیان کرنا سراسر غلطی ہے۔</p>\n\t\t\t</blockquote>\n\t\t\t<p>لسانیات ہی کے ضمن میں عبدالستار صدیقی کا ایک قابلِ قدر مقالہ <annotation lang=\"en\">”Ibn Duraid and His Treatment of Loan Words“</annotation> ہے۔ اس مقالے میں صدیقی صاحب نے عربی لسانیات کے دبستان بصرہ کے آخری سب سے بڑے عالم پر ایک مفصل مقالہ لکھا تھا۔ ابنِ درید نے پچانوے چھیانوے برس عمر پائی اور اب اس کی ولادت پر ۱۱۷۵ برس ہو چکے۔ اس کی ضخیم تصنیف جمھرۃ اللغہہے۔ ابنِ درید خلیج فارس اور ایران میں ایک مدّت تک مقیم رہا۔ دلچسپ بات ہے کہ وہ عالموں میں شاعر اور شاعروں میں عالم مشہور تھا۔ ابنِ درید نے عربی میں مستعار الفاظ کی نشان دہی وسیع پیمانے پر کی تھی۔ جوالیقی نے اپنی معرّب میں ابنِ درید سے جابجا استفادہ کیا تھا بالکل اسی طرح جیسے خود ابنِ درید نے الخلیل کی کتاب العین سے فیض اٹھایا تھا۔ ابنِ درید نے اپنی کتاب میں کتاب العین سے فیض اندوزی کا اعتراف بھی کیا ہے اور اپنی تالیف میں برتے گئے طریق کار کی وضاحت بھی کی ہے۔ ابنِ درید نے عربی حروف تہجی اور ان کی اصوات پر بھی بصیرت افروز بحث کی ہے۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>یہاں اس امر کا اظہار بے محل نہ ہوگا کہ جس زمانے میں عبدالستار صدیقی گوئِ ٹنگن یونیورسٹی سے پی ایچ ڈی کر رہے تھے، اپنے تحقیقی مقالے کی تکمیل تک ابنِ درید کی جمھرۃ اللغہکا ضخیم مخطوطہ نہ دیکھ پائے تھے تاہم اس کے باوجود ابنِ سِیدہ کی مخصَّصاور جوالیقی کی معرّب کے مطالعے سے وہ اس صحیح نتیجے تک پہنچ گئے تھے کہ یہ ابنِ درید ہی تھا جس نے عربی میں مستعار الفاظ کی بڑی تعداد میں نشان دہی کی تھی۔ پی ایچ ڈی کے مقالے کے شائع ہونے کے بعد جب صدیقی صاحب کو ہالینڈ کی لائیڈن لائبریری میں ابنِ درید کی ضخیم لغات جمھرۃ اللغہ کو دیکھنے کا موقع ملا تو ان کا سابقہ قیاس بالکل درست نکلا۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>ابنِ درید کمال درجے کی مجتہدانہ بصیرت کا حامل تھا۔ یہی سبب ہے کہ وہ متعدد مقامات پر اپنے نامور پیشروؤں مثلاً الخلیل، سیبویہ، الاصمعی اور ابو عبیدہ کی تعبیرات سے اختلاف رکھتا تھا۔ صدیقی لکھتے ہیں کہ ”سِجِلّاط“ کے باب میں ابنِ درید، الاصمعی کے اس خیال سے متفق نہیں تھا کہ یہ لفظ فارسی سے مستعار ہے۔ اس کے تجسس نے اسے مجبور کیا اور اس نے ایک یونانی خاتون کو مذکورہ لفظ (سِجِلّاط دراصل ایک طرح کا کپڑا تھا) کی تفصیل بتا کر اس سے پوچھا کہ اسے یونانی (بازنطینی) کس نام سے پکارتے ہیں۔ خاتون نے جواباً کہا: سِجِلّاطس <annotation lang=\"en\">(Sigillatus)</annotation>۔ ابنِ درید کی وسعتِ نظر اور لسانی تگ و تاز کا ذکر کرتے ہوئے صدیقی لکھتے ہیں:</p>\n\t\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\t\t<p>He not only tries to sort out provincial and dialectical words and indicates the localities where they were in use originally, but also distinguishes sharply between the varions dialects of Arabic on one hand and the other semitic languages on the other, and it is only in respect of words from the latter, or, of course, from non-semitic languages that he uses the term معرّب ”Arabicized\". A number of his statements show that Ibn Duraid had a clear idea as to from what sources and in what way loan-words came into Arabic.</p>\n\t\t\t</blockquote>\n\t\t\t<p>صدیقی صاحب چونکہ خودممتاز اور صاحب نظر محقق ہیں لہٰذا اُنھوں نے ابنِ درید کی غیرمعمولی لسانی بصیرت کے اعتراف کے باوجود لکھا ہے کہ عربی میں مستعار الفاظ کے باب میں بعض صورتوں میں اس سے اتفاق کرنا ممکن نہیں تاہم اس سے انکار نہیں کیا جاسکتا کہ اس کا طریقِ کار درست تھا۔ مقالے کے اخیر میں صدیقی صاحب نے ابنِ درید کی کتاب کی تیسری جلد کا وہ باب نقل کیا ہے جس میں مستعار الفاظ سے بحث کی گئی ہے اور وہ اقتباسات درج کیے ہیں جو مستعار الفاظ سے متعلق ہیں اور پوری کتاب میں جابجا موجود ہیں۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>یہ بات معلوم ہے کہ تاریخی لسانیات کی مقتضیات میں سے ایک یہ بھی ہے کہ اس منہاج سے استفادہ کرنے والے کی عہد بہ عہد تاریخ اور جغرافیہ اور دیگر متعلقات پر بھی کافی ووافی نظر ہونی چاہیے۔ صدیقی ان تقاضوں سے خوب آگاہ تھے چنانچہ ان کی تحریروں سے جابجا تاریخی اور جغرافیائی معلومات پھوٹی پڑتی ہیں۔ وہ ’بغداد‘ کے نام کے پہلے حصے ”بغ“ کا ذکر کرتے ہوئے نہیں بھولتے کہ اور بھی کئی قریے ایسے ہیں جن کا سابق ’بغ‘ ہے مثلاً ہرات اور مَرۡو کے درمیان ایک قصبہ بَغشُور (جسے صرف بَغ بھی کہتے ہیں)، ارمینیا میں ایک بغاوَند، ایک بَغرَوند۔ یہ اور اس طرح کے دیگر متعدد پیش کردہ نظائر سے اندازہ ہوتا ہے کہ صدیقی صاحب لسانیات کے بین العلومی منہاج سے خوب واقف تھے۔ وہ عہدِ وسطیٰ کے مسلم مورخین و ادبا مسعودی، احمد ابن یحییٰ بلاذری، البیرونی اور یاقوت حموی وغیرہ کے علمی آثار سے استفادہ کر کے اپنی لسانی تحقیقات کو استوار کرتے تھے۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>ابھی اوپر دبستانِ بصرہ کے نامور عالم ابنِ درید کیجمھرۃ اللغہ اور اس کے ان مباحث کا ذکر ہوا جو معرّبات سے متعلق تھے۔ خود معرّبات سے صدیقی صاحب کی دلچسپی قرار ناآشنا تھی اور اگر یہ کہا جائے کہ آخروقت تک رہی تو غلط نہ ہوگا۔ ”معرّب لفظوں میں حرفِ ”ق“ کی حیثیت“ انھوں نے اپنی عمر کے آخری حصے (۱۹۶۱ئ) میں لکھا اور یہاں بھی تاریخی اور تقابلی تحقیق کا حق ادا کر دیا مثلاً اس مقالے کے آغاز ہی میں انھوں نے اپنے وسیع لسانی مطالعے کا ثبوت دیتے ہوئے لکھا کہ ”ق“ جس آواز کی نیابت کرتا ہے وہ تمام سامی زبانوں میں پائی جاتی ہے۔ آریائی زبانیں اس حرف سے خالی ہیں تاہم ترکی اس سے مستثنیٰ ہے کہ غیر سامی ہونے کے باوجود اس میں ”ق“ کی صَوت موجود ہے (واضح رہے کہ ترکی بقول صدیقی نہ سامی زبان ہے نہ آریائی بلکہ تاتاری ہے)۔ اس مقالے سے اس دلچسپ حقیقت کا بھی پتا چلا کہ بعض اوقات کسی زبان کے متغیر ہوجانے والے لفظوں اور آوازوں کی محافظت ان کی اصل صورت میں کسی اور علاقے یا جغرافیائی خطّے کی زبان بھی کرتی ہے جیسے مثلاً ارمنی زبان میں فارسی لفظوں کی پرانی شکلیں محفوظ ہیں۔ ارمنی ایرانی زبان نہیں بلکہ اس علاقے کی زبان ہے جو ایران کے شمال مغرب میں آذر بائیجان سے ملحق ہے۔ صدیقی لکھتے ہیں:</p>\n\t\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\t\t<p>فارسی زبان کے محققوں کو ارمنی سے بہت مدد ملی اور بہت سی کھوئی ہوئی کڑیاں مل گئیں چنانچہ جن لفظوں میں ’ک‘ یا ’گ‘ باقی نہیں رہا تھا ارمنی سے اس کا وجود یقینی ہو گیا۔ جو ’ک‘ سامی زبانوں میں ’ق‘ ہو گیا ہے وہ ارمنی میں ’ک‘ ہے اور جس ’گ‘ نے سامی میں ’ج‘ کا تلفظ اختیار کیا، ارمنی میں وہ اب بھی ’گ‘ ہے۔</p>\n\t\t\t</blockquote>\n\t\t\t<p>”معرّبات“ سے اسی غیرمعمولی لگاؤ کے پیش نظر صدیقی صاحب نے معرّباتِ عبدالرشید تتوی(م۔۱۰۷۷ھ) کا ایک قلمی نسخہ رام پور اسٹیٹ لائبریری سے ڈھونڈ نکالا۔ حیدرآباد دکن والا نسخہ ان کا اپنا مملوکہ تھا۔ انھوں نے اس کی ترتیب کا کام بقول ڈاکٹر مظہر محمود شیرانی بیسویں صدی کے چھٹے عشرے کی ابتدائ میں شروع کر دیا تھا(رسالہ معرّباتِ رشیدی، کراچی، ص۷)۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>معرّباتِ رشیدی کی تدوینِ نو (۲۰۰۳ئ، مرتّبِ ثانی: ڈاکٹر مظہر محمود شیرانی) کے مطالعے سے پتا چلتا ہے کہ مرحوم صدیقی صاحب نے معرّباتِ رشیدی کو نسخۂ حیدرآباد (جو ان کا ذاتی نسخہ تھا اور ۱۹۲۱ئ میں اپنے قیام حیدرآباد کے زمانے میں انھیں ملا تھا) اور نسخۂ اسٹیٹ لائبریری رامپور کے تقابل کے بعد مدوّن کیا تھا۔ موخرالذکر نسخہ انھیں ۱۹۴۶ئ میں ملا تھا۔ انھوں نے اپنے حیدرآبادی نسخے کو اساسی نسخہ قرار دیا تھا مگر اسے بھی محققانۂ ژرف نگاہی سے جانچا اور آنکا تھا۔ ڈاکٹر شیرانی لکھتے ہیں:</p>\n\t\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\t\t<p>انھوں نے نسخۂ ب (حیدرآبادی نسخہ) کو اساسی نسخہ قرار دیا لیکن آنکھیں بندکرکے اس پر اعتماد نہیں کیا۔ چنانچہ پاورقی (کذا) میں دونو نسخوں کے متن کا فرق دکھایا گیا ہے۔ علاوہ ازیں مختصر حواشی اور بعض کتابوں کے حوالے بھی درج کیے گئے ہیں۔ رسالہ ہٰذا کی تشریحی زبان فارسی ہے اس لیے مرتب نے حواشی بھی فارسی میں دیے ہیں۔ صرف ۲۹ صفحہ پرمعجم البلدان کا ایک مختصر اقتباس عربی میں ہے۔</p>\n\t\t\t</blockquote>\n\t\t\t<p>معرّباتِ رشیدی ۱۹۵۵ئ میں شائع ہوئی۔ اس میں وہ انگریزی دیباچہ شامل نہیں جو لکھا تو گیا مگر صدیقی صاحب کی غیرمعمولی مثالیت پسندی کے باعث خود ان کے لیے موجبِ اطمینان نہیں رہا تھا۔ اس کے کم و بیش دوبرس بعد آقاے محمد عباسی نے تہران سے فرہنگِ رشیدی شائع کر دی جس کے دوسرے حصے کے آخر میں انھوں نے اضافہ شدہ رسالہ معرّبات رشیدی بھی شامل کر دیا جو انھیں مخطوطے کی صورت میں دستیاب ہوا تھا۔ نسخۂ تہران کی اس اشاعت کے باعث صدیقی صاحب کو اپنے مطبوعہ نسخے پر نظرثانی کرنا پڑی چنانچہ انھوں نے اپنے نسخے پر نسخۂ تہران کی روشنی میں کچھ حواشی لکھے لیکن اپنی گوناگوں مصروفیات اور گرتی ہوئی صحت کے باعث وہ اُس نسخے کا اپنے نسخوں سے متنی تقابل کرنے کا حق ادا نہ کرپائے۔ یہ کام مرحوم مشفق خواجہ کے ایما پر جناب مظہر محمود شیرانی نے کیا اور حق یہ ہے کہ ان کی مساعی سے معرّباتِ رشیدی کی ایک اطمینان بخش تدوین اہلِ علم کے ہاتھ آئی۔ شیرانی صاحب نے صدیقی صاحب کے انگریزی دیباچے کا اردو ترجمہ بھی اپنی تدوین میں شامل کیا اور مرحوم کے جملہ حواشی بھی اپنے حاشیوں کے اضافے کے ساتھ شامل تدوین کیے۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>معرّباتِ رشیدی مرتّبہ عبدالستار صدیقی کے مختصات کیا ہیں اور انھوں نے مؤلف عبدالرشید تتوی کے حالات اور اس کے علمی کارناموں کی تفصیل کے ضمن میں کیا لکھا اور اس پر مرتب ثانی نے کیا کیا اضافے کیے اس کی تفصیل کا یہ محل نہیں مگر اتنی بات اطمینان سے کہی جاسکتی ہے کہ مرتب ثانی کی غیر معمولی تحقیقی کاوش جتنی بھی قابلِ داد سہی اس کی بنیاد گذاری بہرحال عبدالستار صدیقی ہی کے مبارک ہاتھوں سے ہوئی۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>لفظ و لسان سے ڈاکٹر صدیقی کے عشق و انسلاک کے متعدد مظاہر ان کی اور بہت سی تحریروں میں بھی بخوبی دیکھے جاسکتے ہیں۔ مختلف فرہنگوں کے صحت و سقم پر بھی ان کی گہری نظر تھی اور یہ گہری نظر دراصل متعدد زبانوں کے عمیق مطالعے کا حاصل تھی۔ ”ہندستان بغیر واؤ کے صحیح ہے“ نامی مقالے میں، جس سے پہلے بھی استشہاد کیا جاچکا ہے، ایک جگہ تین بڑی اہم فارسی فرہنگوں فرہنگِ جہانگیری، برہانِ قاطع اور بہار عجم کا ذکر کرتے ہیں۔ وہ انھیں مستند مانتے ہیں مگر ان کے بعض مشمولات کو قابلِ اصلاح سمجھتے ہیں۔ لکھتے ہیں:</p>\n\t\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\t\t<p>فرہنگ جہانگیری کی فروگذاشتوں کی تلافی کی غرض سے فرہنگِ رشیدی تصنیف ہوئی۔ برہانِ قاطع پر غالبؔ نے اعتراضوں بلکہ خوردہ گیریوں کی بوچھار کی۔ کتنے جواب اور جواب الجواب لکھے گئے۔۔۔ ناصرالدین شاہ قاچار کے عہد میں رضاقلی خاں ہدایتؔ (صاحبِ تذکرۂ مجمع الفصحا) نے یہ کوشش کی کہ ٹکسالی فارسی کا ایک لغت ترتیب دے۔ اسی کوشش کا نتیجہ ہے فرہنگِ انجمن آراے ناصری۔ کتاب کے طویل مقدمے میں مصنف نے اپنے پیشرولغت نویسوں کی غلطیاں چُن چُن کر گنائی ہیں اور فرہنگ کے متن میں بھی جابجا اَوروں کی لغزشوں کا ذکر کیا ہے۔ رضاقلی خاں کی کتاب اس لحاظ سے زیادہ مستند خیال کی جاتی ہے کہ اس کے پیشِ نظر متقدمین، متوسّطین اور متاخّرین کی تصنیفوں کا بیش قرار ذخیرہ تھا اور اس نے ایران میں بیٹھ کر فارسی کا لغت لکھا جو اس کی زندگی ہی میں چھپ بھی گیا۔</p>\n\t\t\t</blockquote>\n\t\t\t<p>جس زمانے میں ڈاکٹر سید عبداللہ نوادرالالفاظ (آرزوؔ) کی تدوین کر رہے تھے، ڈاکٹر صدیقی نے جس اخلاص اور جانکاہی سے سید صاحب کی رہنمائی کی اس کی تفصیل خود سید عبداللہ نے نوادرالمکاتیب کی تمہید میں فراہم کر دی ہے۔ نوادرالالفاظ کے متنازع فیہ الفاظ کی ترتیب دادہ فہرست کے اُن الفاظ کے تلفظ اور ان کے متروک اور مروّج معانی کی صدیقی صاحب نے غیر معمولی تحقیق کی اور اس ضمن میں متعدد پیشہ وروں سے مل کر ان الفاظ کی گرہیں کھولیں۔ نوادرالالفاظ کے مقدمے میں سید عبداللہ کے اس اعتراف میں کوئی مبالغہ نہیں سمجھنا چاہیے جب انھوں نے لکھا کہ عبدالستار صدیقی (اور عرشی) کی مراسلتیں اگر شائع کر دی جائیں تو اہلِ علم کے لیے یہ مراسلتیں بجاے خود غرائب اللغات اور نوادرالالفاظ بن جائیں۔ بعدازاں جب سید صاحب نے نوادرالمکاتیب کے زیر عنوان ان خطوں کا ایک حصہ اردو نامہ، کراچی میں شائع کر دیا تو واقعی ان کے مذکورہ قول کی تصدیق ہو گئی۔ صرف چند ایسے مقامات ملاحظہ فرمائیے:</p>\n\t\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\t\t<list>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>کباب کئی قسم کے ہوتے ہیں۔ بڑی قسمیں دو ہیں۔ ایک وہ جو سیخ پر بھونے جاتے ہیں یعنی قیمے کو مہین پیس کر اور نمک اور مسالہ لگا کر سیخ پر لپیٹ دیتے ہیں اور پھر سیخ کو آگ دکھاتے جاتے ہیں اور پھریری سے تھوڑا تھوڑا گھی چپڑتے جاتے ہیں۔ دوسرے وہ جو کڑھائی میں ڈال کر تلے جاتے ہیں یعنی شامی کباب، شکم پر کباب وغیرہ۔ اس دوسری قسم کے کباب کو الٹنے کے لیے ایک آلہ استعمال ہوتا ہے جس کی شکل ارّے کی سی ہوتی ہے۔ فرق صرف یہ کہ ڈنڈی چھوٹی ہوتی ہے۔ شکل کی مناسبت سے قرینِ قیاس ہے کہ اسے بھی اس زمانے میں ارّا کہتے ہوں (اور فارسی کتابت کے اثر سے ”ارّہ“ لکھتے ہوں)۔</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>میں نے لکھنؤ سے دریافت کیا تو معلوم ہوا کہ وہاں کے نانبائی تنور میں سے روٹی نکالنے کے دونوں آلوں کو جو ایک ساتھ استعمال ہوتے ہیں ”جوڑی“ کہتے ہیں۔ وہ سیخ جس کا ایک سرا چپٹا (کھرپی کی شکل کا) ہوتا ہے ”ارّا“ کہلاتی ہے اور دوسری سیخ جس (کی) نوک مڑی ہوئی ہوتی ہے ”طوطا“ (یعنی توتا) کے نام سے پکاری جاتی ہے۔ یہ تو نانبائیوں کی اصطلاحیں ہوئیں۔ بسکٹ بنانے والوں سے دریافت کیا گیا۔ میرا پرچہ نویس لکھتا ہے کہ بسکٹ والوں کے ہاں ایک آلہ ہے جسے ”ارا“ (بلاتشدید) کہتے ہیں مگر اس آلے سے جلانے کی لکڑی تنور میں ڈالتے ہیں۔ ظاہر ہے بسکٹ پکانے والوں کی اصطلاحیں مستحدث ہوںگی۔ اصل وہی نانبائیوں کی اصطلاحیں ہیں۔</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li> ”پٹا دینا“۔ اس زمانے میں ”پٹی دینا“ ورغلانے یا دھوکا دینے کے لیے بولا جاتا ہے۔ اگلے زمانے میں ”پٹّا“ ہوگا۔ لفظ وہی ہے۔ ”پٹی پڑھانا“ بھی بولتے ہیں۔</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li> ”پھرت“، وہ چیز جو پھردی جائے۔ زرِ ناسرہ بھی صرّاف پھیر دیتا ہے، قبول نہیں کرتا۔ </li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li> ”پتا دیولی“، اسی طرح لکھا ہے۔ اس کے دو مرادف (فارسی) لکھے ہیں ایک پِرِستُوک (اور پِرِ ستُواور پِرِ ستُک) دوسرا بادخورک۔ اصل عبارت یہاں نقل کرتاہوں: \n\t\t\t\t\t”پتادیولی مرغکِ سیاہ کہ پیوستہ درپرواز باشد و آنرا پاپیل (کذا) نیز گویند بادخورک ببائِ موحدہ و پرستوک و پرستووپرستک ہرسہ ببای فارسی و سینِ مہملہ و(ضمِ) فوقانی“\n\t\t\t\t\t”پاپیل“ ظاہرا ”ابابیل“ کی تصحیف ہے۔ عربی لفظ ابابیل کو ہندستانیوں نے غلط طور پر ایک خاص پرندہ سمجھا اور اردو میں پرستوک (=وطواط =

ایسا معلوم ہوتا ہے کہ بادخورک ایک افسانوی پرندہ ہے اور اسی لیے بعضے فرہنگ نگاروں نے اسے ’ہما‘ کا مرادف قرار دیا ہے۔ </li>\n\t\t\t\t</list>\n\t\t\t</blockquote>\n\t\t\t<p>اوپر کے اقتباسات سے بہ آسانی اندازہ ہوتا ہے کہ ڈاکٹر صدیقی لفظ و لغت کے کھوج میں کتنا لمبا سفر کرنے کے قائل تھے۔ ”پتادیولی“ کی تشریح میں وہ فارسی فرہنگوں سے استشہاد کرتے ہیں۔ یہ درست ہے کہ کم و بیش سارے ہی فارسی فرہنگ نویس پرستوک / پرستو اور بادخورک /بادخور کو ایک جانتے ہیں تاہم یہ معلوم نہیں ہو پایا کہ کون سے فرہنگ نگاروں نے بادخورک کو ’ہما‘ کا مرادف قرار دیا ہے۔ برہانِ قاطع، غیاث اللغات، فرہنگِ معین اور لغت نامۂ دھخدا، سے لے کر فرہنگِ عمید اور تازہ ترین قابلِ قدر فرہنگ یعنی فرہنگ بزرگِ سخن (دکتر حسن انوری) تک دیکھ جائیے پرستو/پرستوک/ بادخورک کے حوالے سے متعدد حیران کن تفصیلات ملیں گی مگر کہیں یہ نظر نہ آئے گا کہ بادخورک ’ھما‘ کے مترادف ہے۔ لغت نامۂ دھخدا تو دراصل تمام اہم لغات کا جامع ہے مگر اس میں بھی مذکورہ حوالہ نہ مل پایا۔ علاوہ ازیں یہ عرض کرنا بھی ضروری ہے کہ پرستو/پرستوک میں ’پ‘ اور ’ر‘ کو لغت نویسوں نے کسرہ اور فتحہ دونوں سے لکھا ہے۔ بے محل نہ ہوگا اگر چند اہم فرہنگوں سے مذکورہ الفاظ کے معانی درج کر دیے جائیں:</p>\n\t\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\t\t<list>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>ادخورک: مرغکی است سیاہ و کوچک واو پیوسہ در پروازمی باشد، گویند غذای او باداست و اگر در جای نشیند دیگر نتواند برخاست و بعضی گویند ابابیل ھمان است“۔ برہانِ قاطع، ص۱۴۴۔</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>پرستو: بکسرِ اول و ثانی و سکون ثالث و ضمِ فوقانی و واوِ ساکن۔ بمعنی پرستک است کہ خطّاف باشد و بعضی گویند پرستو و طواط است کہ آن خطافِ کوھی باشد“ __ برہانِ قاطع، ص۲۴۸۔</li>\n\t\t\t\t</list>\n\t\t\t</blockquote>\n\t\t\t<p>اسی لغت میں پرستو کے بعد پرستوک کے تحت اوپر کے معانی درج کرنے کے بعد اس پرندے کے بارے میں کچھ محیرّالعقول باتیں لکھی ہیں جنھیں اُسطور کا درجہ دیا جاسکتا ہے مثلاً لکھا ہے کہ جب چاند بڑھ رہا ہو اور پرستو کے پہلے بچے کو پکڑ کر اس کا پیٹ چاک کریں تو اس میں سے دو سنگریزے نکلیں گے۔ ایک تو یک رنگ اور دوسرا رنگا رنگ۔ جب اسے (یا انھیں) بچھڑے یا پہاڑی بکرے کی کھال میں لپیٹ کر (اس پر گرد و غبار پڑنے سے پہلے) کسی مصروع (مرگی کے دورے میں مبتلا) کے بازو پر باندھ دیں یا اس کی گردن میں حمائل کر دیں تو مرگی کا مرض جاتا رہے گا اور کہتے ہیں کہ اگر دو ابابیلیں (پرستوک) ایک نر ایک مادہ پکڑ کر ان کے سر آگ میں جلا کر شراب میں ڈال دیں تو جو بھی وہ شراب پیے گا ہرگز مست نہ ہوگا اور اگر اس کا خون عورتوں کی خوراک میں شامل کر کے انھیں کھلا دیا جائے تو ان کی شہوت جاتی رہے گی۔۔۔ وغیرہ وغیرہ۔

مترادف قرار نہیں دیا گیا۔</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>فرہنگِ عمید میں پرستو کے کچھ اور مترادفات مثلاً فرشتوک، بلسک، بالوایہ، بالوانہ، پالوانہ، پیلوانہ، دالیوز اور باسیچ بھی دیے گئے ہیں ___ فرہنگ عمید جلد اول،

ملاحظہ فرمائیے:</p>\n\t\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\t\t<list>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li> ابھی تک اتنی فرصت نہیں ملی کہ انشا کی ترکی کی گتھیاںسلجھانے کی کوشش کروں۔ وہ جو ملّاحوں کی بولی کی نقل اتاری ہے وہ بنگال کے ملاحوں کی نقل ہے۔ بنگالی زبان کی بہت ہی عام چیز یہ ہے کہ آپ کا ہر فتحہ ان کے ہاں ضمّہ ہو جاتا ہے اور اکثر کسی قدر اِشباع کے ساتھ اور کبھی پورا و ہو کر ان کی زبان سے نکلتا ہے جیسے گھر کو گھور اور گنگا کو گونگا کہتے ہیں۔ انشا پیدا ہی بنگال میں ہوئے تھے۔ ملاحی کا پیشہ کرنے والے بنگال میں مسلمان ہی ہیں اس لیے یہ بہت قرینِ قیاس ہے کہ بنگال کے ملاح مراد ہیں۔</li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>کھانے سب تو نہیں جو سامنے تھے ہو چکے۔ ایک لذیذ چیز رہ گئی۔ اودھ کے قصبوں میں ”جھجلے“ پکتے ہیں اور اودھ ہی میں کہیں کہیں ان کو ”شیرازے“ بھی کہتے ہیں۔ عربی میں پانی نچوڑے ہوئے دہی یا پنیر کو ”شیراز“ کہتے ہیں اور جمع دو طرح پر آتی ہے ”شراریز“ اور ”شواریز“۔ برہانِ قاطع میں لکھا ہے کہ بعضوں نے اس لفظ کو عربی بتایا ہے۔ عربی لغت کی کتابوں میں اسے فارسی بتایا ہے اور یہی صحیح ہے۔ فارسی میں علاوہ پنیر کے بعض مٹھائیوں، مربّے اور اچار کو بھی کہتے ہیں۔ ”جھجلے“ بھی میٹھی چیز ہے۔ معلوم نہیں ایران کی کس خاص مٹھائی کی مشابہت سے ”شیرازے“ نام پڑا۔</li>\n\t\t\t\t</list>\n\t\t\t</blockquote>\n\t\t\t<p>”جھجلے“ کی کچھ اور دلچسپ تفصیل صدیقی صاحب نے اپنے بہت معلومات افزا مضمون ”کچھ بکھرے ہوئے ورق“ مشمولہ ہندستانی میں بھی دی ہے۔ یہ تفصیل لطیف احمد عثمانی بلگرامی کی مختصر سوانح کے ذیل میں دی گئی ہے جو غالب سے اپنے کلام پر اصلاح لیتے تھے۔ صدیقی لکھتے ہیں:</p>\n\t\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\t\t<p>ایک روایت یہ بھی مشہور ہے کہ لطیف ایک بار اپنے استاد( غالبؔ) سے ملنے دلی گئے تو ان کے لیے بلگرام سے ”جھجلے“ پکوا کر ساتھ لے گئے۔ غالبؔ کو یہ مزیدار چیز ایسی پسند آئی کہ سولہ سترہ شعر اس کی تعریف میں کہہ ڈالے جن میں سے صرف ایک ہی اب لوگوں کو یاد رہ گیا ہے: خوشا لذتِ جھجلۂ بلگرام۔ کہ شبنم از و تازگی کردوام</p>\n\t\t\t</blockquote>\n\t\t\t<p>گمان ہے کہ ”جھجلے“ کی لذت کے اسیر غالبؔ ہی نہیں صدیقی صاحب بھی تھے۔ تبھی تو مذکورہ اقتباس کے حاشیے میں اس کے اجزائے ترکیبی اور اس کے بنانے کا طریقہ تک بیان کر دیا:</p>\n\t\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\t\t<p>یہ لذیذ پکوان اودھ کے اکثر قصبات میں عام ہے۔ ماش کی دال کو سِل پر پیستے اور چھان پھینٹ کر اس کے چھوٹے چھوٹے گلگلے بناتے ہیں اور انھیں گھی میں تل کے قوام یا دودھ میں ڈال دیتے ہیں۔ بعض مقامات پر ان کو ”شیرازے“ اور کہیں ”نازکیاں“ بھی کہتے ہیں۔</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>(حاشیہ ہندستانی، ص۴۸۲)</p>\n\t\t\t</blockquote>\n\t\t\t<p>کیا معلوم کہ جب میرؔ نے ذیل کا شعر کہا ہوگا تو اس میں ”نازکی“ کے لفظ میں شیرینی لب کے ساتھ ساتھ ”شیرازے“ کی شیرینی اور لذت بخشی کا ایہام بھی رکھا ہو (آخر عمر کا طویل حصہ اُنھوں نے اودھ ہی میں بسر کیا تھا):</p>\n\t\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\t\t<verse>\n\t\t\t\t\tناز کی اس کے لب کی کیا کہیے\n\t\t\t\t\tپنکھڑی اک گلاب کی سی ہے\n\t\t\t\t</verse>\n\t\t\t</blockquote>\n\t\t\t<p>قابلِ مبارک باد ہیں ڈاکٹر صدیقی جیسے زبان شناس جنھوں نے اردو کے کتنے ہی گم شدہ خوابیدہ الفاظ کو قم باذن اللہ کہہ کر جگایا اور ہماری تہذیبی توسیع کا سروسامان کیا! کیا ہم ’مشکل خواں‘، ’چاشنی گیر‘ (نمونہ گیر) ’سود اور‘ (سوداگر)، ٹاٹ بافی، ’میدہ سالار‘، ’مائدہ سالار‘ (چاشنی گیر)، ’جھجلے‘ اور ’شیرازے‘ ایسے غیر معمولی الفاظ کو بھول نہیں گئے تھے؟</p>\n\t\t\t<p>املا اور صحتِ املا کے باب میں بھی ڈاکٹر صدیقی کی کاوشیں قابل داد ہیں۔ صحتِ املا کے ضمن میں وہ ان اصحاب میں سے ہیں جن پر سابقون الاوّلون کی ترکیب کا اطلاق ہوتا ہے۔ وہ اس خیال کے زبردست علمبردار تھے کہ اردو املا کی معیار بندی ضروری ہے۔ ان کا خیال تھا کہ ہر معاشرے میں بڑا گروہ مقلدوں اور عادت کے بندوں کا ہوتا ہے اور تدارک یا اصلاح کی ذمہ داری اہلِ تحقیق پر عائد ہوتی ہے۔ وہ اس خیال کے مؤیّد تھے کہ اہلِ تحقیق املا کے لیے قواعد سازی کریں۔ اس ضمن میں انھوں نے جو نہایت اہم تجاویز پیش کیں وہ ان کے ایک قابلِ قدر مقالے ”اردو املا“ اور بعض دیگر تحریروں میں موجود ہیں۔ انھوں نے بجا طور پر اس امر پر اصرار کیا کہ ہندی لفظ ہو تو اسے ہ کے بجائے الف پر ختم ہونا چاہیے سواے مقاموں کے ناموں کے مثلاً پٹنہ، آگرہ وغیرہ۔ اسی طرح ان لفظوں کے آخر میں بھی الف لکھا جانا چاہیے جو ایک اردو اور ایک فارسی یا عربی جُز سے بنے ہوں جیسے تماہا، پچرنگا، وغیرہ۔ وہ اسم جو اِفتِعال یا استفعال کے وزن پر مصدر ہیں اور ان کے آخر میں الف کے بعد ہمزہ ہے، یہ فارسی اور اردو میں گر جاتا ہے اور ایسے لفظوں کو مندرجہ ذیل صورت میں لکھا جانا چاہیے: ابتدا، ارتقا، اِقتدا، اِسۡتِقرا، استقصا وغیرہ۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>صحت املا کے ضمن میں ڈاکٹر صدیقی کی ایک اور اہم تجویز یہ تھی کہ مختفی ہ پر ختم ہونے والے مذکر اسم جب واحد محرف حالت میںہوں تب بھی ان کا تلفظ وہی ہوتا ہے جو جمع قائم کی حالت میں ہوتا ہے ایسی صورت میں ”میں مدرسہ جاتا ہوں“، ”شیر کے پنجہ میں بڑی طاقت ہوتی ہے“ کے بجاے یوں لکھنا قرین صحت ہوگا: ”میں مدرسے جاتا ہوں“، شیر کے پنجے میں بڑی طاقت ہوتی ہے“ وغیرہ۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>ہمزے کے سلسلے میں صدیقی صاحب کا موقف یہ تھا اور بالکل درست تھا کہ اردو میں ہمزہ الف کا قائم مقام ہے لہٰذا جب دو حروفِ علت اپنی الگ الگ آواز دیں تو ان کے درمیان ہمزہ آتا ہے جیسے آئو، جائو، گائ و، مگر بھاو تاو، کھاو، کڑھاو میں ہمزہ غیر ضروری ہے۔ اسی طرح لیے، دیے، کیے میں بھی ہمزہ غیر ضروری ہے۔ صدیقی صاحب تمام عمر اپنی تحریروں میں الگ الگ آواز دینے والے دو حروفِ علت کے درمیان ہمزہ لکھتے رہے جیسے تم آئ و تو آم لیتے آئ و، وغیرہ مگر اردو دنیا نے ان کے اس صحیح موقف کو قابل قبول نہ سمجھا اور ہمزے کو ہمیشہ و کے اوپر علامت کے طور پر استعمال کیا یعنی تم آؤ تو آم لیتے آؤ۔ جب جاؤ مجھے بتا کر جاؤ وغیرہ۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>ہمزے ہی کے ضمن میں ان کا یہ قول بھی صحیح تھا کہ ایرانیوں کے یہاں ہمزہ بہت کم استعمال ہوتا ہے اور وہ معمولاً ہمزے کی جگہ ی استعمال کرتے ہیں۔ چونکہ اردو زبان میں ہمزے کا چلن بہت ہے لہٰذا ایرانیوں کی پیروی کے بجاے عربی لفظوں کو جواردو میں مستعمل ہوتے ہیں، ہمزے سے لکھنا چاہیے جیسے تائب، قائل، سائل، حقائق، خائن، شائع وغیرہ۔ ان کا یہ کہنا بھی اپنے اندر بڑا وزن اور صداقت رکھتا تھا کہ راے، جاے، خداے وغیرہ پر ہمزہ نہیں آنا چاہیے۔ علاوہ ازیں جب کسی لفظ کے آخر میں ہاے مختفی آئے اور وہ لفظ کسی دوسرے لفظ سے مل کر مرکب بنا رہا ہو تو ہاے مختفی پر ہمزہ لانا چاہیے نہ کہ کسرہ جیسے مثلاً درجۂ عالی، تودۂ خاک وغیرہ۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>رشید حسن خاں نے اپنی کتاب اُردو املا میں جابجا عبدالستار صدیقی کی لسانی بالغ نظری اور اُردو املا کے باب میں ان کے مجتہدانہ مگر متوازن نقطۂ نظر کی توصیف کی ہے۔ ان کی اُردو املا پر جگہ جگہ صدیقی صاحب کا فیضان کارفرما نظر آتا ہے۔ شاید یہی وجہ ہے کہ اُنھوں نے اس کتاب کا انتساب بھی صدیقی صاحب ہی کے نام کیا۔ اُنھوں نے اس کتاب میں کئی مقامات پر عبدالستار صدیقی کی اُردو املا کی معیار بندی کے سلسلے کی خدمات کا کھل کر اعتراف کیا ہے۔ ایک جگہ لکھتے ہیں:</p>\n\t\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\t\t<p>اس زمانے میں ڈاکٹر عبدالستار صدیقی مرحوم واحد شخص تھے جنھوں نے اس موضوع کا مستقل موضوع کی حیثیت سے مطالعہ کیا اور بار بار لوگوں کی توجہ اس طرف مبذول کرائی۔ رسالہ ہندستانی، رسالہ اردو، رسالہ معیار میں ان کے نہایت اہم مضامین محفوظ ہیں۔ ان کے علاوہ مختلف کتابوں کے تبصروں اور مقدموں میں بھی وہ ان مسائل کا بار بار ذکرکرتے رہے۔ ان میں مقدمۂ کلیاتِ ولیؔ، مقدمۂ خطوطِ غالبؔ (مرتّبہ منشی مہیش پرشاد) تبصرۂ مکاتیبِ غالبؔ (مرتّبہ عرشی۔۔۔) خاص طور پر قابلِ ذکر ہیں۔ اس کے علاوہ بہت سے خطوں میں انھوں نے املا کے مسائل و اغلاط کی طرف لوگوں کو متوجہ کیا۲۷۔۔۔ انجمن ترقیِ اُردو نے اصلاح املا کی تجاویز کو جس انداز سے مرتب کیا تھا۔۔۔ اور جس طرح اس موضوع کو اہمیت دی تھی، اس میں ڈاکٹر صاحب مرحوم کی کاوشوں کو بہت زیادہ دخل تھا۔</p>\n\t\t\t</blockquote>\n\t\t\t<p>یہ وہ زمانہ تھا جب اردو املا کے سلسلے میں بعض نہایت مضحکہ خیز تجاویز (مثلاً یہ کہ اردو میں ایک آواز کے لیے ایک ہی حرف ہونا چاہیے، س، ث، ص ان تین حرفوں میں سے س کو باقی رکھا جائے وغیرہ وغیرہ) انقلابی تجاویز کے طور پر سامنے لائی جارہی تھیں۔ رشید حسن خاں اعتراف کرتے ہیں ایک زمانے میں وہ خود ان تجاویز کے پھیر میں آچکے تھے مگر ڈاکٹر عبدالستار صدیقی کی ”فہمائش اور تعلیم نے اُس ’جہادِ کم نظری‘ کے پیچ و خم سے نجات دلائی“ (اردو ملا، ص۲۹)۔ خان صاحب نے صدیقی صاحب کو املا کے موضوع پر ”استادِ کل“ قرار دیا ہے۔ حقیقت یہ ہے کہ اردو املا کے سلسلے میں ڈاکٹر عبدالستار صدیقی اور ان سے کچھ پہلے احسنؔ مارہروی کی خدمات کو ہمیشہ یاد رکھا جائے گا۔ یہ البتہ اُردُو دنیا کی بدقسمتی ہے کہ املا کے سلسلے میں وہ اب تک دوعملی کا شکار ہے۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>یہ بات معلوم ہے کہ ڈاکٹر صدیقی بنیادی طور پر عربی زبان و ادب کے آدمی تھے۔ عربی زبان و لسانیات سے انسلاک کے باوجود وہ اردو زبان و ادب سے بھی اٹوٹ وابستگی رکھتے تھے اور اردو زبان کے الگ اور منفرد تشخص کے نہ صرف قائل تھے بلکہ اس پر اصرار بھی کرتے تھے۔ اس ضمن میں منجملہ اور موارد کے وحید الدین سلیم کی وضعِ اصطلاحات پر ان کا نہایت مفصل ریویو ملاحظہ کیا جاسکتا ہے جس میں وہ اردو کو ترقی دینے کے لیے جو تجاویز دیتے ہیں ان میں کتابوں کے ناموں، بابوں اور فصلوں کے عنوانوں کے لیے اردو تراکیب کے استعمال کی ترغیب دیتے ہیں اور چاہتے ہیں کہ کتاب کے ابواب کی گنتی بابِ دوم بابِ سوم وغیرہ کے بجائے دوسرا باب تیسرا باب کی صورت میں ہونی چاہیے تاکہ اُردو کے اُردو پن کو نہ صرف برقرار رکھا جا سکے بلکہ اسے تسلسل دیا جا سکے۔ ”بعض پرانے لفظوں کی نئی تحقیق“ کے زیرعنوان اپنے معروف مضمون کے آخر میں زیرِسطح وہ ان حضرات سے ناخوش نظر آتے ہیں جو نہ صرف یہ کہ اُردو الفاظ و تراکیب استعمال نہیں کرتے بلکہ ایسے الفاظ و محاورات کی تعریب بھی کرڈالتے ہیں۔ لکھتے ہیں:</p>\n\t\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\t\t<p>بنگال کے بعض مسلمان بزرگوں کو میں نے ’غول مال‘ بولتے سنا ہے۔ گول مال کی شاید تعریب فرمائی ہے۔ دور کیوں جائیے خود ہمارے ہاں ایسے لوگ ابھی موجود ہیں جو ’بیگم‘ کو ’بیغم‘ اور ’کاغذ‘ کو ’قاغذ‘ بولتے ہیں۔</p>\n\t\t\t</blockquote>\n\t\t\t<p>اُردو کے اردو پن پر اسی اصرار کے باعث وہ مکتوب الیہم کو ”مکتوب الیہوں“ (”مکتوب الیہوں کے حالات جمع کر کے شائع کیے جائیں“۔ تحقیق شمارہ ۱۲،۱۳: ص۳۳۷) لکھتے ہیں اور فارسی اور عربی کے ان لفظوں کو جو سہ حرفی ہیں اور درمیان کے حرف کے سکون کے ساتھ ہیں مثلاً فِکۡر، شَمۡع، تحۡت، شہر وغیرہ، ان کے بارے میں فرماتے ہیں کہ یہ لفظ بچلے حرف کی حرکت کے ساتھ فصیحوں کی زبان پر جاری ہیں اور یہی صحیح ہیں۔ یوں کہہ کر وہ ولی کے اس طرح کے تلفظ کردہ لفظوں کا دفاع کرتے ہیں اور اس ضمن میں ناصرؔ علی سرہندی کا ایک مصرع بطور حوالہ درج فرماتے ہیں:</p>\n\t\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\t\t<verse>\n\t\t\t\t\tبتِ فرنگی بہ قتلِ ہمنا رکھے جو پُر چیں جبیں دمادم\n\t\t\t\t</verse>\n\t\t\t</blockquote>\n\t\t\t<p>اور عربی لفظ کی ہندی لفظ سے ترکیب دینے پر مسرت کا اظہار کرتے ہیں۔ میرے نزدیک یہاں دو امور کو پیشِ نظر رکھنا ضروری ہے۔ ایک تو یہ کہ زبان کے تشکیلی دور کے شعرا، آج جب اردو زبان بہت منجھ چکی ہے، ہمارے لیے سند نہیں بن سکتے۔ دوسرے یہ کہ سہ حرفی لفظوں مثلاً عقل، شہر، تحت وغیرہ کا درمیانی حرف کی حرکت کے ساتھ فصحا کی زبانوں پرجاری ہونے کا دعویٰ بھی محل نظر ہے اور اگر ایساہے بھی تو یہ اس امر کی دلیل نہیں کہ ان الفاظ کو حرکت کے ساتھ ہی قبول کر لیا جائے۔ تقریر کی زبان اور تحریر کی زبان میں یوں بھی فرق ہوتا ہے اور ہمیشہ رہا ہے۔ اگر ولیؔ دکنی، ناصرؔ علی سرہندی یا تشکیلی دور کے دیگر شعرا کے نظائر ہمارے لیے سند ہو سکتے ہیں تو سوال یہ ہے کہ کیا ہمارے ممتاز لغت نگاروں (مثلاً سید احمد دہلوی، نورالحسن نیّر کاکوروی یا صاحبِ فرہنگِ شفق) نے انھیں بطور مثبت امثال و نظائر کے برتا ہے؟ میرے خیال میں اس کا جواب نفی میں ہے۔ اگر برتا بھی ہو تو یہ لکھ دینے کا اہتمام ضرور موجود ہے کہ اب یہ لفظ یا ترکیب متروک ہے یا قوسین میں وضاحت موجود ہے کہ غلط العوام ہے جیسا مثلاً فوق البھڑک وغیرہ۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>ڈاکٹر صدیقی کو اردو زبان اور اس کے لسانی مسائل و معاملات کے ساتھ ساتھ اس کے ادبیات سے جو غیرمعمولی ربط و تعلق تھا، امتیاز علی عرشی کے نام ان کے بعض مکاتیب اس پر شاہد ہیں مثلاً ایک خط میں خواجہ احسن اللہ دہلوی بیانؔ (یا بہ روایت دیگر خواجہ احسن الدین خان بیانؔ)کے مختصر دیوان کا ذکر کرتے ہیں جس میں شامل دو مثنویاں ”چپک نامہ“ اور ”تعریف چاہِ مومن خاں“ کلیاتِ سوداؔ کے نولکشوری ایڈیشن میں بھی الحاقی طور پر شامل ہیں۔ صدیقی صاحب کے پاس مذکورہ دیوان کا وہ نسخہ تھا جو خود شاعر کا اصلاح کردہ تھا۔ اس سے اندازہ کیا جاسکتا ہے کہ یہ نسخہ کس قدر اہم تھا۔ افسوس صدیقی صاحب اس کی تدوین نہ کر سکے۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>اردو ادب ہی کے ایک زندہ اسم اسد اللہ خاں غالبؔ سے بھی صدیقی صاحب کو گہرا لگاؤ تھا۔ انھوں نے غالب کی بعض نایاب تحریریں اپنے مقالے ”کچھ بکھرے ہوئے ورق“ میں شائع کی تھیں۔ اس مقالے میں منجملہ اور تحریروں کے غالب کے بعض اہم خط اور فسانۂ عجائب پر ان کی تقریظ شامل تھی۔ صدیقی صاحب نے ان تحریروں پر بہت عمدہ حواشی بھی لکھے تھے۔ انھوں نے خطوطِ غالبؔ مرتّبہ مہیش پرشاد کی جلد اول پر نظر ثانی بھی کی تھی اور اس پر مقدمہ بھی لکھا تھا۔ علاوہ ازیںانشاے غالبؔ پر اُن کے مفصل اور مفید حواشی ”کچھ اور بکھرے ورق“، ”غالبؔ کے خطوں کے لفافے“ مکاتیبِ غالبؔ (مرتبہ امتیاز علی عرشی) پر مفصل تجزیاتی مقالہ، ”دہلی سوسائٹی اور مرزا غالبؔ“ ___ یہ سب غالبیات میں نادر اضافوں کی حیثیت رکھتے ہیں اور غالب کی شخصیت و فکر کے تہہ رس مطالعات کی برہان مہیا کرتے ہیں۔ علاوہ ازیں اپنے کچھ مکاتیب میں بھی صدیقی صاحب نے غالب کے بعض لسانی معتقدات کے باب میں اپنا زاویۂ نگاہ بڑی صراحت سے بہ دلائل بیان کیا ہے۔ غالبؔ پر ان تحریروں کو پڑھ کر احساس ہوتا ہے کہ صدیقی صاحب نے اُن کے باب میں کیسے کیسے اہم جزئیوں کو اِن تحریروں میں محفوظ کر لیا ہے مثلاً ”کچھ اور بکھرے ورق“ میں غالب کے ایسے مکاتیب شائع کیے گئے جو اب تک غیر مطبوعہ تھے۔ ان مکاتیب کے اصل متن خود غالبؔ کے اتھ کے لکھے ہوئے تھے جو صدیقی صاحب کے ہاتھ آئے۔ ”غالبؔ کے خطوں کے لفافے“ بظاہر ایک غیر اہم موضوع ہے لیکن اس سے بھی صدیقی صاحب نے کتنے اہم نکتے نکالے ہیں مثلاً یہی کہ ان لفافوں کو دیکھنے سے پتا چلتا ہے کہ غالبؔ نے جس طرح اپنی مکتوباتی تحریروں میں زوائد کو ترک کر دیا تھا، لفافوں پر پتے کی عبارت میں بھی رفتہ رفتہ اختصار پیدا کر لیا تھا۔ پھر اپنے زمانے کے عام دستور کے خلاف غالبؔ بعض اوقات بجاے فارسی کے اردو میں پتے لکھا کرتے تھے وغیرہ۔ مکاتیبِ غالبؔ پر صدیقی صاحب کا مفصل ریویو پڑھنے سے بخوبی اندازہ ہوتا ہے کہ وہ اپنے معاصرین کی تحریروں کو بھی کیسی عمیق تنقیدی نگاہ سے دیکھتے تھے اور ان کے محاسن کے دوش بدوش ان کی خامیوں اور کوتاہیوں سے بھی صرفِ نظر نہیں کرتے تھے۔ یہ مفصل تبصرہ بتاتا ہے کہ معیاری تدوین کے تقاضے کیا ہوتے ہیں، املا میں کن اصولوں کی پاسداری کرنی چاہیے، واقعاتی غلطیوں سے کیسے بچا جاسکتا ہے، حواشی کی طوالت کتنی ہونی چاہیے، بعض خاص اسما (معرفہ) کے سابقے کے سلسلے میں کیا احتیاط ملحوظ رکھنی چاہیے۔ صدیقی صاحب نے اپنے بڑے دلچسپ اور نہایت معلومات افزا مضمون ”دہلی سوسائٹی اور مرزا غالبؔ“ میں بتایا ہے کہ اُنیسویں صدی کے دوسرے نصف میں سانحۂ ستاون کے چند برس بعد جو بہت سی علمی انجمنیں وجود میں آئی تھیں ان میں ایک دہلی سوسائٹی بھی تھی۔ اس کے بارے میں معلومات کا واحد ماخذگار سیں دتاسی کی تحریریں تھیں مگر ان میں سوسائٹی کے بارے میں معلومات بیشتر تشنہ اور کہیں کہیں غلط تھیں۔ خوش قسمتی سے پنڈت کیفی کے توسط سے صدیقی صاحب کو سوسائٹی کے شائع کردہ چار شمارے دیکھنے کو مل گئے جن میں سوسائٹی کی سرگرمیوں کی تفصیلات اور بعض تحریریں چھپی تھیں جو اس سوسائٹی میں پڑھی گئی تھیں۔ سوسائٹی کی بنیاد اس زمانے کے دلی کے کمشنر کرنل ہملٹن کی تحریک سے پڑی اور اس کے ارکان میں ایک غالبؔ بھی تھے۔ انھوں نے سوسائٹی کے ایک جلسے منعقدہ ۱۱ اگست ۱۸۶۵ئ میں ایک مضمون پڑھا تھا جو سوسائٹی کے پہلے شمارے میں شائع ہوا۔ صدیقی صاحب نے اس کا متن رسالے سے نقل کر کے اپنے مقالے میں شائع کیا۔ اس مضمون کے علاوہ غالب سے متعلق کئی اہم معلومات اس مقالے میں یکجا کر دی گئی ہیں جو حیاتِ غالبؔ کے ضمن میں بنیادی مآخذ کا درجہ رکھتی ہیں۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>مطالعاتِ غالبؔ کے ضمن میں ایک مبحث ’ز‘ اور ’ذ‘ کا بھی ہے۔ مراد یہ ہے کہ آیاگذشتن، پذیرفتن کو ’ذ‘ سے لکھنا چاہیے یا ’ز‘ سے۔ اس بحث کا آغاز غالبؔ کے اس مؤقف سے ہوا کہ فارسی زبان میں ذالِ معجمہ نہیں دادمہملہ ہے۔ صدیقی صاحب نے ”ذال معجمہ فارسی میں“ کے عنوان سے غالبؔ کے مؤقف کے برخلاف کثیر و قوی دلائل سے ثابت کیا کہ فارسی میں ذال معجمہ موجود رہی ہے۔ صدیقی صاحب غالبؔ کے حوالے سے لکھتے ہیں کہ موصوف کہتے تھے کہ ”ذ“ کا فارسی نہ ہونا ان کا اپنا نہیں ان کے نام نہاد آموز گار ”ہرمزد پارسی نژاد“ کا قول ہے جبکہ قصہ یہ ہے کہ غالبؔ کے اصل مآخذ فرہنگِ جہانگیری و رشیدی ہیں (مقالاتِ صدیقی، ص۸۸)۔ یہی بات صدیقی صاحب نے عرشی کے نام ایک مکتوب میں بھی لکھی: ”غالبؔ علیہ رحمہ نے یہ خیال رشید ٹھٹھوی سے اخذ کیا ہے کہ ذال معجمہ فارسی میں نہیں ہے لیکن خان آرزوؔ نے ٹھٹھوی کے اس خیال پر اعتراض کیا ہے“ (نقوش بحوالۂ سابقہ:ص۷۱)۔ فارسی ادبیات و لسانیات کے نامور عالم ڈاکٹر نذیر احمد کو بھی صدیقی صاحب کے موقف سے کامل اتفاق تھا۔ نقدِ قاطعِ برہان میں لکھتے ہیں:</p>\n\t\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\t\t<p>غالبؔ ذال فارسی کے منکر تھے حال آں کہ اس کے وجود سے انکار گویا بدیہیات سے انکار کے مترادف ہے۔ متعدد فاضلوں نے اس ضمن میں تفصیل سے مضامین لکھے ہیں۔ ہندوستان کے دو اہم دانش مندوں نے بھی اس موضوع پر مفصل گفتگو کی ہے۔ میری مراد ڈاکٹر عبدالستار صدیقی صاحب مرحوم اور قاضی عبدالودود صاحب سے ہے۔ </p>\n\t\t\t</blockquote>\n\t\t\t<p>تاہم ڈاکٹر نذیر احمد کو صدیقی صاحب سے اس امر میں اختلاف تھا کہ آٹھویں صدی عیسوی کے ختم ہونے تک ’د‘ نے ’ذ‘ کو پوری طرح بے دخل کر دیا تھا۔ انھوں نے عبدالوہاب قزوینی کے ایک قول سے استشہاد کرتے ہوئے لکھا کہ آٹھویں صدی کے بعد بھی ذالِ معجمہ ملتی ہے گو آہستہ آہستہ اس کا استعمال کم ہوتا گیا۔ نذیر احمد کے خیال میں نویں صدی کے وسط کے بعد تک ایسے نسخے ملتے ہیں جن میں ذال کا استعمال برابر نظر آتا ہے۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>صدیقی صاحب کا غالبؔ سے ربط و تعلق ایک مقلّد کا نہیں مجتہدانہ نظر رکھنے والے عالم کا تھا۔ یہی وجہ ہے کہ ان کے ہاں غالبؔ سے اتفاق و اختلاف کی متعدد صورتیں نظر آتی ہیں۔ عبدالصمد پارسی والے قصے کو وہ غالب کی گھڑنت سمجھتے تھے اور برہانِ قاطع والے مباحث کے بارے میں ان کا نقطۂ نظر یہ تھا کہ ان سب کو یکجا شائع ہونا چاہیے۔ انھیں غالبؔ کے اس خیال سے شدید اختلاف تھا کہ ہندستان کے فضلا خان آرزوؔ، غیاث الدین رامپوری (صاحب غیاث اللغات) اور رشید تتوی (صاحبِ فرہنگ رشیدی و معرّبات) تو منہ لگانے کے قابل نہیں مگر ”فضلاے کلکتہ“ (جنھوں نے برہان کی لغزشوں کو مانا تھا) بقول صدیقی ”گویا سیدھے ایران سے تشریف لائے تھے“ (نقوش بحوالۂ سابقہ: ص۲۸) میرا خیال ہے کہ اس باب میں غالبؔ شدید دو عملی کا شکار رہے۔ معاملہ صرف یہیں تک نہیں۔ وہ غنیمتؔ کنجاہی کا ذکر بھی جابجا حقارت سے کرتے ہیں مگر اپنی مثنوی ”چراغِ دَیر“ میں کئی مصرعے اور ترکیبیں غنیمتؔ کی مثنوی نیرنگِ عشق سے اڑا لیتے ہیں۔ ایک زمانے میں صدیقی تیغِ تیز اوربرہانِ قاطع کے مباحث کو خود مرتب کر کے شائع کرنا چاہتے تھے مگر اے بسا آرزو۔۔۔ ان کی اس آرزو کو ڈاکٹر نذیر احمد اور قاضی عبدالودود نے عملی جامہ پہنایا۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>چونکہ صدیقی صاحب بنیادی طور پر لسانی تحقیق کے آدمی تھے، ان کی عملی تنقید بھی لسانیات کی چاردیواری ہی میں اپنا روپ رس دکھاتی ہے۔ ان کی عملی تنقید کا ایک نمونہ تومکاتیبِ غالبؔ پر مفصل محاکمے کی صورت میں قبل ازیں زیربحث آچکا ہے۔ دیگر دو قابلِ توجہ اور دیر تک یاد رکھے جانے والے تنقیدی، لسانی مقالات وضعِ اصطلاحات (وحید الدین سلیم) اور المبین (سید سلیمان اشرف) پر مفصل تجزیوں کی صورت میں لکھے گئے۔ مؤخّرالذکر مقالہ معلوم نہیں کیوںمقالاتِ صدیقی میں جگہ نہ پاسکا۔ پہلے ہم وضعِ اصطلاحات پر ان کے افادات کا اجمالی ذکر کرتے ہیں۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>ڈاکٹر صدیقی نے وحید الدین سلیم کی وضع اصطلاحات پر تبصرہ خود سلیم کی دعوت پر ۱۹۲۶ئ میں لکھا۔ وحید الدین سلیم نے اس تبصرے کو بہت سراہا۔ صدیقی صاحب نے اس تبصرے میں چند بڑی قابلِ بحث اور توجہ طلب باتیں لکھی ہیں۔ دیگر بہت سارے جدید ماہرین لسانیات کی طرح صدیقی صاحب بھی اس نظریے کے مؤیّد تھے کہ زبان انسان کے ساتھ ہی وجود میں آئی۔ گو کہ ان ابتدائی مدارج میں ذخیرۂ الفاظ بہت کم تھا۔ انھوں نے لفظ آسمان کے بارے میں لکھا کہ انسان کی ابتدائی تاریخ اس قیاس کو جنم دیتی ہے کہ اسے پہلے آسمان نظر آیا۔ چکی (آسیا) بنانے کی نوبت تو بہت بعد میں آئی ہوگی سو ایسا نہیں کہ آسیا سے لفظ آسمان بنا ہو۔ پھر یہ بھی کہ قدیم فارسی میں آسمان دراصل اَسۡمَن تھا، پہلوی میں آکر آسمان بنا۔ اس سے ثابت ہوا کہ یہ مان (جو حقیقت میں من تھا) مانند کے معنی نہیں رکھتا۔ آس مخفف ہے آسیا یا آسیاو کا۔ صدیقی صاحب کے نزدیک ”آسیاو“ صرف پہلوی میں ملتا ہے۔ اسی طرح انھوں نے سلیم کے اس خیال سے بھی اتفاق نہیں کیا کہ ”خر“ والے مرکبات میں خر ”بزرگ“ کے معنی میں آتا ہے۔ ان کے خیال میں ”خر“ خُرّہ یا خَرَہ کی ایک صورت تھی جس کے معنی جاہ و جلال اور شان و شوکت کے ہیں لہٰذا خرگاہ سے مراد بڑا خیمہ نہیں، شان و شوکت والی جگہ ہے۔ انھوں نے اس وسیع طور پر پھیلے ہوئے خیال کی بھی تغلیط کی کہ ”زند“ کوئی زبان ہے۔ ”زند“ دراصل ”اوستا“ کے متن کا کئی صدی بعد ترجمہ ہے۔۔۔ لوگ غلطی سے زند اور پازند دونوں کو زبانیں سمجھ بیٹھے (مقالات صدیقی، ص۲۶۳)۔ ان کے نزدیک یہ غلط فہمی سب سے پہلے یورپی محققوں نے پھیلائی۔ انھوں نے شہاب الدین احمد خفاجی کے حوالے سے اس قیاس آرائی کی بھی تردید کی کہ ”ہیولیٰ“ ”ہیئتِ اُولیٰ“ کا مخفّف ہے۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>۱۹۲۹ئ میں علیگڑھ مسلم یونیورسٹی کے ممتاز استاد سید سلیمان اشرف نے المبینکے نام سے ایک عمدہ اور مباحث خیز کتاب لکھی۔ اس کی تسوید کا بڑا محرک یہودی مستشرق جرجی زیدان کی کتاب فلسفۃ اللغۃ العربیہ بنی جس میں اس نے یہ دعویٰ کیا تھا کہ عربی زبان مختلف زبانوں سے مستعار الفاظ کا ملغوبہ ہے۔ عربی میں مادہ ثنائی ہے ثلاثی نہیں اور تیسرا حرف جو زائد ہوتا ہے اس کا مقام متعین نہیں وہ اول، آخر، اوسط کہیں کا بھی ہو سکتا ہے۔ نیز عربوں نے ایک لفظ کہیں سے پاکر اس کے معنی سیکھ لیے اور پھر اسی ایک لفظ کو الٹ پلٹ کرتے چلے گئے تاآنکہ عربی زبان میں الفاظ کی کثرت نظر آنے لگی۔ سلیمان اشرف صاحب نے جرجی زیدان کے ان خیالات کی تردید کی اور عربی زبان کے فضائل، عربی زبان کا حیرت انگیز کمال گویائی، فلسفۂ ارتقائے زبان اور فلسفۂ اشتقاق جیسے موضوعات پر لکھ کر یہ ثابت کرنے کی سعی کی کہ ”عربی زبان میں جب کوئی لفظ موضوع قرار پاتا ہے تو اس کا بامعنی ہونا ایسا مستحکم و مضبوط ہوتا ہے کہ جس پہلو سے اس کو لوٹا پھیرا جائے وہ موضوع ہی رہتا ہے (یعنی مہمل نہیں ہوتا)۔ ایک صورت سے دوسری صورت کی طرف منتقل ہونے پر بھی معنی کا ساتھ نہیں چھوٹتا۔“ (المبین، ص۴۷) گویا جب کسی موضوع لفظ کو اس کی ساری ممکنہ ہئیتوں (جو چھے سے زیادہ نہیں ہوسکتیں) کی طرف تبدیل کرتے جائیں اور ہر تبدیلی میں وہ لفظ بامعنی رہے تو اسے اشتقاقِ کبیر کا نام دیا جاتا ہے۔ اس کے بعد صاحبِ المبین نے ق م ر (قمر) سے اشتقاقِ کبیر کی مثالیں دی ہیں جو نظر بہ ظاہر بہت حیران کن لسانی صورتِ حال کا باعث بنتی ہیں۔ مصنف نے اسی عمل کو اشکالِ ستّہ کے ذریعے بتیس مثالوںتک پھیلا دیا ہے!</p>\n\t\t\t<p>ڈاکٹر صدیقی نے اس کتاب پر ”المبین پر تعقب و تبصرہ“ کے زیر عنوان معارف کے ۲۵ صفحات پر مشتمل ایک مفصل تجزیاتی مقالہ لکھا اور مصنف کے بعض دعاوی کو دلائل اور متانت سے ردّ کیا۔ ان کے خیال میں عربی زبان کے محققوں میں سے کسی نے یہ نہیں کہا کہ عربی اور عجمی میں وہی نسبت ہے جو عجمی زبانوں اور جانوروں کی آوازوں میں ہے۔ ان کے مقالے کے دیگر اہم نکات کچھ یوں تھے:</p>\n\t\t\t<list>\n\t\t\t\t<li>روف تہجّی کے مخرج کا تعین کرنا صوتیات کے ماہروں کا کام ہے نہ کہ خود زبان کا۔</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>ایسی زبان کا وجود محال ہے جس میں یہ آزادی ہو کہ بولنے والا کسی آواز کو جہاں سے اس کا جی چاہے ادا کرے۔</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>مصنف کی ساری کوشش عربی زبان کو افضل ترین زبان ثابت کرنا ہے مگر یہ راہ تو سیدھی ترکستان کو گئی ہے۔</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>مصنف المبین نے نہ صرف تاریخی ملاحظات کو بالاے طاق رکھا بلکہ السنہ کے اثریات اور تاریخی مواد کا مطالعہ کرنے والوں کی تضحیک کی۔</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>جب کسی لفظ کی اصل کی تحقیق کی جاتی ہے تو اس کے ابتدائی مفہوم سے بحث کی جاتی ہے اور مرادی یا تشبیہی معنی یا وہ معنی جو بعد کو پیدا ہوئے، بحث سے قطعاً خارج کر دیے جاتے ہیں۔</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>مصنف نے بعض لفظوں کے معانی نکالنے میں بہت کھینچ تان کی ہے۔</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>مستشرقین کا ماخذ جرجی زیدان یا فون ڈائک کی تصانیف نہیں، ان کا ماخذ انھی بزرگوں کی تصانیف ہیں جنھوں نے اسلام کے عہدِ زرّیں میں علومِ عرب کی بنیاد رکھی تھی۔</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>عربی کے اندر مادّہ بلاشبہہ سہ حرفی ہے، اس کے دو حرفی ہونے کی بحث محض عربی سے متعلق نہیں بلکہ اس قدیم سامی زبان سے متعلق ہے جس سے تمام سامی زبانیں (عربی، آرامی، عبرانی وغیرہ) نکلی ہیں۔ یہ بات صاحبِ المبین کی نظر میں اس لیے نہیں آسکی کہ وہ تاریخ سے بحث کرنا جائز نہیں سمجھتے۔</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>المبینکی بنیاد فلسفۂ اشتقاق پر رکھی گئی ہے مگر اہلِ لغت ”اشتقاقِ کبیر“ کو تسلیم نہیں کرتے۔</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>سیوطی کے نزدیک صرف ”اشتقاقِ اصغر“ مستند ہے۔ ”اشتقاقِ اکبر“ محققوں کی نگاہ میں کوئی چیز نہیں۔ یہ زبان میں موجبِ فساد ہے۔ </li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>لسانیات کا غیر جانبدار فن ایک زبان کی دوسری زبان پر برتری ثابت کرنے کی اجازت نہیں دیتا۔</li>\n\t\t\t\t<li>مصنف کا یہ خیال کہ یورپ کے علما کی رائے میں عربی کوئی مستقل زبان نہیں، سراسر غلط فہمی پر مبنی ہے مستشرق یا غیر مستشرق کسی نے یہ خیال ظاہر نہیں کیا۔</li>\n\t\t\t</list>\n\t\t\t<p>ڈاکٹر صدیقی کے اس تجزیے سے بخوبی اندازہ ہوتا ہے کہ یہ المبین پر بڑی حد تک ایک عالمانہ تبصرہ ہے اور ہر عہد کے مستند مصنفین اور ماہرین السنہ کے دلائل سے پوری طرح لَیس۔ اس تبصرے کے جواب میں مولانا اکرام اللہ خان ندوی اور مفتی عبداللطیف صاحب پروفیسر جامعہ عثمانیہ کے استدراک معارف ہی کے بعد کے شماروں میں شائع ہوئے۔ ان میں اول الذکر کا جواب زیادہ قابلِ توجہ ہے کیونکہ اس میں صدیقی صاحب کے بعض نکات کا رد اس بنیاد پر کیا ہے کہ انھوں نے المبین کے بعض مباحث کا غور سے مطالعہ نہیں کیا۔ اکرام اللہ صاحب نے بعض بہت عمدہ لُغوی بحثیں کی ہیں مگر اوراق کی تنگ دامانی ان کے ذکر سے مانع ہے۔ لازم ہے کہ ان مباحث کا تقابلی مطالعہ کیا جائے تاکہ اور کئی علمی نکات سامنے آسکیں۔ میرا ذاتی خیال یہ ہے کہ اگر صاحبِ المبین اپنے مباحث کو محض مادّے کے ثنائی ہونے کے رد تک محدود رکھتے اور ”اشتقاق کبیر“ کے پھیر میں نہ آتے تو ان کی کتاب زیادہ مؤثر اور بامعنی ہوتی۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>ڈاکٹر صدیقی صاحب کی، لسانی مباحث کی حامل تحریروں سے ہٹ کر بھی کچھ ایسے مضامین ہیں جو لائقِ توجہ ہیں جیسے مثلاً حافظ محمود شیرانی کی وفات پر ان کا مضمون جس میں انھوں نے حضور اکرمؐ پر ڈاکٹر ہنری سٹب Stubbe کی پردۂ خفا میں کئی صدیوں سے مستور کتاب کو منظرِ عام پر لا کر اس کی حیاتِ نو کا اہتمام کرنے پرشیرانی کو داد دی اور اسے ان کا پہلا شان دار علمی کام قرار دیا۔ اسی طرح وحید الدین سلیم پانی پتی اور ڈاکٹر اشپرنگر پر ان کے مضامین بھی بہت سے شخصی اور علمی نکات کو آئینہ کرتے ہیں۔ مؤخرالذکر شخصیت پر ان کا مقالہ خاص طور پر چشم کشا اور انکشاف خیز ہے خصوصاً اس کے وہ اقتباسات جو صدیقی صاحب نے اشپرنگر کی حضور اکرمؐ پر جرمن کتاب سے براہ راست ترجمہ کر کے شاملِ مضمون کیے۔ اسی طرح صدیقی صاحب کے مقالے ”معائبِ سخن کلامِ حافظؔ کے آئینے میں“ اور ”شاہجہان کی ایک منبّت کار تصویر“ (مطبوعہ آج کل، دہلی، ستمبر ۱۹۵۰ئ) بھی دامنِ دل کھینچتے ہیں۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>وسعت مطالعہ، عمق نگاہی اور آرائش و زیبائش سے پاک علمی اسلوب کی حامل ڈاکٹر صدیقی کی تحریریں ایک مستقل حوالے کی چیز ہیں۔ وہ علم و لسان کو آب بند خانوں میں اسیر کرنے کو ناپسند کرتے تھے۔ بہت کم مقامات ہیں جہاں ان کی تحریروں سے اختلاف کی ضرورت محسوس ہوتی ہے مگر بہرحال ایسے مقامات ہیں ضرور۔ مثال کے طور پر ڈاکٹر شوکت سبزواری نے ”عبدالستار صدیقی مرحوم اور ان کی لسانی تحقیقات“ میں بعض لسانی امور پر ڈاکٹر صدیقی سے جائز اختلاف کیا ہے مثلاً لفظ ”کھیدا“ ہاتھی کو پکڑنے کا گڑھا نہیں، ہاتھی کو گھیر کر (یعنی ہانکا کر کے) قید کرنے کے معنوں میں ہے۔ انھیں اس سے بھی اتفاق نہیں کہ ”سِکرّر“ ”مکرر“ کا تابع مہمل ہے۔ خود شوکت سبزواری سے بھی اس مضمون میں ایک سہو ہوا ہے جہاں انھوں نے صدیقی صاحب کی علمی تحصیلات کے ضمن میں لکھا ہے کہ انھوں نے سیبویہ کی الکتاب پر تحقیقی کام کر کے پی ایچ ڈی کی ڈگری لی تھی، درآں حالیکہ صدیقی صاحب کا پی ایچ ڈی کا موضوع تھا:کلاسیکی عربی میں فارسی کے مستعار الفاظ۔ مقالہ جرمن زبان میں لکھا گیا تھا۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>ابنِ درید پر انگریزی میں لکھے گئے عالمانہ مقالے کے آخر میں صدیقی صاحب نے جمھرۃ اللغہ کا مستعار الفاظ والا باب درج کیا ہے۔ اس میں ایک مقام پر ابنِ درید نے لفظِ ”برجیس“ کی تشریح میں لکھا ہے:</p>\n\t\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\t\t<p><annotation lang=\"ar\">والبِرجیس ویقال البِرجیس نجم من نجوم السمآئ و یقال ہو بہرام</annotation></p>\n\t\t\t</blockquote>\n\t\t\t<p>ابن درید کا یہ کہنا کہ ”برجیس“ کو ”بہرام“ بھی کہا جاتا ہے درست نہیں۔ برجیس فلکِ ششم کا سیّارہ ہے اور سعد ہے جبکہ بہرام فلکِ پنجم کا سیّارہ ہے اور مِرّیخ کہلاتا ہے۔ اس کا رنگ سرخ ہے سو اسی نسبت سے اسے جلّادِ فلک بھی کہتے ہیں۔ یہ نحۡس ہے، چنانچہ مِرّیخ (بہرام) و زُحَل ایک برج میں آئیں تو اسے ”قِران النَحۡسَین“ کہتے ہیں۔ مراد یہ ہے کہ ابنِ دُرَید کے اس سہو پر ڈاکٹر صدیقی کو حاشیہ لکھنا چاہیے تھا۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>اِسی طرح اپنے مقالے ”اُردو املا“ میں ایک جگہ صدیقی ذرّہ اور ذرا کو زیر بحث لا کر لکھتے ہیں کہ ذرّہ تشدید کے ساتھ ”کسی چیز کا بہت چھوٹا ٹکڑا“ کے معنوں میں آتا ہے جبکہ ذرا معنوی طور پرذرّہ سے مختلف ہے لہٰذا اسے ذرا کے بجاے زرا لکھنا چاہیے۔ قیاس چاہتا ہے کہ ذرا کے پیدا ہونے کا باعث ذرّہ ہی ہے تو پھر اس کو ذال کے بجاے ز سے لکھنے پر اصرار کیوں۔ دلچسپ بات یہ ہے کہ یہ لفظ فارسی میں انھی معنوں میں آتا ہے جیسے اردو میں یعنی بہت کم۔ تھوڑا۔ ایرانی کہے گا: معنیِ رحم ذرّہ ای دردل اونیست یا ذرہ ای سود نہ بخشید (یعنی ذرا بھی فائدہ نہ ہوا)۔ فارسی میں یہ ذرا کے معنی ہی میں مستعمل ہے اور ذال ہی سے لکھا جاتا ہے۔ خود اردو میں اس کا املا ذال ہی سے رہا ہے اور ہے۔ جب مستند اہلِ علم تک اسے ذال سے لکھتے ہیں تو پھر اسی املا کو فصیح اور معتبر سمجھنا چاہیے۔ علاوہ ازیں اردو شعرا میں بھی خال خال ذرّہ بمعنی ذرا استعمال ہوا ہے۔ صبا کا شعر ہے:</p>\n\t\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\t\t<verse>\n\t\t\t\t\tذرّہ بھی نہیں ہے زرِ قاروں کی یہاں قدر\n\t\t\t\t\tدنیا کو سمجھتے ہیں ترے در کی گدا خاک\n\t\t\t\t</verse>\n\t\t\t</blockquote>\n\t\t\t<p>ڈاکٹر صدیقی کی گہری، ہمہ گیر اور وسعتِ نظر کی حامل لسانی اور دیگر تحریریں اس کی متقاضی تھیں کہ ان پر تفصیل سے لکھا جاتا مگر افسوس ہے کہ ان کی عظمت کا بہت کم اعتراف کیا گیا۔ عبدالستّار دلوی کا مقالہ ”اردو میں لسانی تحقیق کی اہمیت“ تحقیق پر شائع ہونے والے کئی منتخبات کا حصہ بنا مگر مرتبین میں سے کسی نے پلٹ کر نہ پوچھا کہ اس میں عبدالستار صدیقی کے عدم شمول کا سبب کیا ہے؟</p>\n\t\t\t<p>اہلِ علم اس حقیقت سے بخوبی آگاہ ہیں کہ تاریخی لسانیات بنیادی طور پر حرکی مزاج کی حامل ہے۔ یہ زبان کا مطالعہ اس میں ہونے والے تغیرات کے حوالے سے کرتی ہے۔ ایسے تغیرات جو زبان میں زمان و مکان دونوں حوالوں سے آتے ہیں۔ ان تغیرات کا تعلق تاریخی عناصر سے ہوتا ہے۔ تاریخی لسانیات سے کام لینے والے، کتبوں اور قدیم و عہدِ وسطیٰ کی تحریروں اور آثار سے مدد لیتے ہیں۔ تاریخی لسانیات اپنی بنیاد تحریری شہادتوں پر رکھتی ہے۔ پھر یہ بھی دیکھتی ہے کہ خاص زبانوں کے مابین تاریخی رشتے کیا ہیں۔ یوں اس کے ڈانڈے تقابلی لسانیات سے جا ملتے ہیں۔ پھر کوئی زبان یہ دعویٰ نہیں کر سکتی کہ اس میں مستعار الفاظ کا ذخیرہ نہیں۔ لسانیات کے محققوں مثلاً ماریوپائی وغیرہ کا خیال ہے کہ انگریزی زبان کا اپنا اینگلوسیکسن ذخیرہ ۲۵ فیصد سے زیادہ نہیں۔ پچھتّرفی صد ذخیرۂ الفاظ مستعار ہے۔ مستعار لینے والی زبان یا تو اُس لفظ کو اپنے صوتی و صورتی نظم پر ڈھال لیتی ہے جیسے پرانی فرانسیسی کا لفظ <annotation lang=\"en\">”Verai“</annotation> انگریزی کے <annotation lang=\"en\">”Very“</annotation> میں ڈھل گیا یا پھر یہ کہ مستعار لینے والی زبان اُس لفظ کو اپنی زبان میں ترجمہ کرلیتی ہے۔ یہ اور اس طرح کے متعدد لسانی حقائق تھے جن سے ڈاکٹر عبدالستار صدیقی اپنی انگلیوں کی آخری پوروں تک آگاہ تھے۔ یہ درست ہے کہ انھوں نے اپنی تحقیقی تگ و دو کے لیے جو میدان چنا وہ عام لوگوں کی دلچسپی سے کوسوں دور ہی نہ تھا، اپنے مخصوص دائرے میں محدود بھی تھا۔ شاید ان کی عدم مقبولیت کا ایک سبب یہ بھی رہا ہوگا مگر ہمیں یاد رکھنا چاہیے کہ عبدالستّار صدیقی جیسے بے مثال ماہر السنہ کو بھول جانا اپنی تہذیبی بے مایگی اور لسانی بے چہرگی کے اعلان کے مترادف ہے۔ ڈاکٹر خالد محمود اور ان کے رفقاے کار لائقِ مبارک باد ہیں کہ ان کے توسّط سے ایک مدّت کے بعد ایک خصوصی اشاعت کے ذریعے ڈاکٹر عبدالستار صدیقی کے علمی و لسانی افادات کی بازیافت اور بازتحقیق کا اہتمام کیا جارہا ہے۔</p>\n\t\t</section>\n\t</body>\n"

This study assessed the DKK3 protein expression in gastric cancer and its potential value as a prognostic marker.', 'DKK3 expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 158 gastric cancer samples from patients who underwent gastrectomy from 2002 to 2008. Clinicopathological parameters and survival data were analyzed.', 'Loss of DKK3 expression was found in 64 of 158 (40.5%) samples, and it was associated with advanced T stage (p<0.001), lymph node metastasis (p<0.001), UICC TNM stage (p<0.001), tumor location (p = 0.029), lymphovascular invasion (p = 0.035), and perineural invasion (p = 0.032). Patients without DKK3 expression in tumor cells had a significantly worse disease-free and overall survival than those with DKK3 expression (p<0.001, and p = 0.001, respectively). TNM stage (p = 0.028 and p<0.001, respectively) and residual tumor (p<0.001 and p = 0.003, respectively) were independent predictors of disease-free and overall survival. Based on the preoperative clinical stage assessed by computed tomography (CT), loss of DKK3 expression was predominantly associated with worse prognosis in patients with clinically node-negative advanced gastric cancer (AGC). The combination of DKK3 expression status and CT increased the accuracy of CT staging for predicting lymph node involvement from 71.5 to 80.0% in AGC patients.']",

The centers were post hoc stratified to \"rapid advancement to full enteral feeds\" (median duration of advancement to full enteral feeds<or =12.5 days; 6 centers), that is, rapid advancement (RA), or \"slow advancement to full enteral feeds\" (median duration of advancement to full enteral feeds>12.5 days; 7 centers), that is, slow advancement (SA).', 'VLBW infants born in centers with SA (n = 713) had a significantly higher rate of sepsis compared with VLBW infants born in centers with RA (n = 717), which was particularly evident for late-onset sepsis (14.0% vs 20.4%; P = 0.002). Furthermore, more central venous lines (48.6% vs 31.1%, P<0.001) and antibiotics (92.4% vs 77.7%, P<0.001) were used in centers with SA.']",

Whether spontaneous remission of PAN occurs is therefore largely unknown.', 'We describe the case of a 51-year-old woman who presented with a 4-day-history of intense pain in her left flank, hypertension, fever, microscopic hematuria, and acute renal failure. Contrast-enhanced renal ultrasound strongly suggested bilateral renal infarction. Medical history and an extensive workup allowed to exclude systemic embolism, recreational drug abuse, cardiac arrhythmias, and thrombophilia. A possible diagnosis of PAN was considered; however, within 2 weeks of admission, spontaneous remission of her clinical and biological symptoms occurred without the use of any immunosuppressive treatment. Finally, 3 months later, renal arteriography confirmed the diagnosis of PAN. The patient remains free of symptoms 1 year after initial presentation.']",

It is important to identify patients with compensated cirrhosis at risk for esophageal varix development. We evaluated the accuracy of a duplex Doppler ultrasonographic index for predicting the presence or absence of esophageal varices in patients with compensated hepatic cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A) by using endoscopy as the reference standard.', 'Fifty-six enrolled patients underwent duplex Doppler ultrasonography followed by screening endoscopy. Mean portal vein velocity (PVV), splenic index (SI), splenoportal index (SPI), hepatic and splenic arterial resistive, and pulsatility indices (hepatic artery resistive index [HARI], hepatic artery pulsatility index [HAPI], splenic artery resistive index [SARI], splenic artery pulsatility index [SAPI]) were recorded. Univariate logistic regression analysis was followed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve construction for the indices that were significant.', 'The indices HARI, HAPI, SARI, SAPI were not helpful (p\\u2009>\\u20090.05). Mean PVV, SI, and SPI were all predictive of the presence of esophageal varices (p\\u2009<\\u20090.05) and SPI was found to be the most accurate parameter. Of the various cut-off levels of SPI evaluated, a cut-off value of SPI at 5.0, offered the highest diagnostic accuracy (88%). For the 28 patients with SPI<5.0, the absence of esophageal varices in 27 of them could be correctly diagnosed using only SPI without invasive screening endoscopy, with high negative predictive value (96%) and sensitivity (96%). Of the remaining 28 patients with SPI ≥5.0, presence of esophageal varices could be similarly correctly diagnosed in 22 of them by using SPI without screening endoscopy, with high positive predictive value (79%) and specificity (82%).']",

In multivariable analysis, the novel classification of the primary tumor was a powerful independent predictor of CSS (p for trend<0.0001).

عقیدت رکھتے ہیں، سوال یہ ہے کہ جس طریقے سے ان کی جان لی گئی کیا وہ درست، جائز اور منصفانہ طریقہ تھا؟ ۔۔۔۔بھٹو کے بارے میں سپریم کورٹ میں صدارتی ریفرنس میں وفاق کے معاون وکیل کی حیثیت سے جو میرے مشاہدات ہیں وہ میں آپ کے سامنے رکھ دیتا ہوں۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>لیکن آغاز ان نفسیاتی گرہوں سے جن کے ساتھ میں جو ان ہوا۔میرا تعلق اس نسل سے ہے جسے بھٹو نفرت کا زہر فکری وراثت میں دیا گیا۔بھٹو کا ذکر چلے تواپنے بچپن کے دن یاد آ جاتے ہیں۔کس شرح صدر کے ساتھ ہم کندھے اچکا کر کہہ دیا کرتے تھے: بھٹو تو اسلام کا دشمن تھا۔شاید اس لیے کہ گاؤں میں ہمارے خاندان کے مفادات مذہبی سیاست سے وابستہ تھے۔چنانچہ دین کی تعبیر کے جملہ حقوق ہمارے نام محفوظ تھے اور ہمارا خاندان اپنی ساری' ہم نصابی سر گرمیوں 'کے باوجود اس بات کا استحقاق رکھتا تھا کہ کھڑے کھڑے کسی کی بھی اسلام دوستی کا آ ملیٹ بنا دے۔چنانچہ جب قبلہ امیر المومنین بقلم خود نے ریفرنڈم میں سوال پوچھا: اسلام چاہتے ہو؟ اور شرح یہ رکھی کہ چاہتے ہو تو پھر میں اگلے پانچ سالوں کے لیے نفاذ شریعت کے لیے صدر بن رہا ہوں تو مردِ مومن مردِ حق کے لیے نعرے لگا لگا کر ہمارے گلے بیٹھ گئے۔ہمارے گاؤں میں صرف تین ووٹ نکلے جنہوں نے مردِ مومن کی اصل واردات کو سمجھا اور کہا ؛نہیں چاہتے۔بس پھر کیا تھا، ہم شریف سائیکلوں والے اور ڈاکٹر پھینا کی دکانوں کے آگے سے گزرتے تو نفرت سے تھوک دیتے۔کم بختوں نے اسلام دشمنی میں حد ہی کر دی تھی۔ہم سب راسخ العقیدہ مسلمان تھے ،تھوڑی دیر بعد منہ اٹھاتے اور چیختے: مردِ مومن مردِ حق۔۔۔۔۔آج سوچتا ہوں جہالت کتنی بڑی نعمت ہوتی ہے۔ہم کتنے آسودہ تھے۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>جب میں نے اسلامک یونیورسٹی اسلام آباد میں انگریزی ادب میں ماسٹرز کی کلاس میں داخلہ لیا تو ملک معراج خالد یہاں کے ریکٹر تھے۔ان کا تعلق پی پی پی سے تھا اور میں صالحین کے گاؤں سے آیا اپنی ذات میں ایک چھوٹا سا امیر المومنین تھا۔پہلا سوال ہی امیر المومنین صاحب نے یہ سوچا: اسلامک یونیورسٹی میں ملک معراج خالد کا کیا کام؟میری گستاخیاں بڑھتی گئیں،خبر ملک معراج خالد تک پہنچ گئی۔ایک روز میری طلبی ہوئی۔شعبہ انگریزی کے سربراہ پروفیسر ایس ایم اے رؤف نے حکم دیا جاؤ تمہیں ریکٹر صاحب نے طلب کیا ہے۔جل تو جلال تو کا ورد کرتے حاضر ہوا تو یہاں کا منظر ہی اور تھا۔چند منٹ کی ملاقات کے بعد جب میں باہر آیا تو محسوس ہوا دل وہیں چھوڑے جا رہا ہوں۔تعلق بڑھتا گیا۔ایک شام میں اورافتخار سید ملک معراج خالد کے گھر گئے تو اندر سے قرآن کی تلاوت کی آواز سنائی دی۔ملک صاحب کے سارے احترام کے باوجود میں نے حیرت سے پوچھا: افتخار یار یہ تو مذہبی آدمی ہیں۔افتخار نے طنزیہ کہا: امیر المومنین صاحب کسی اور کو بھی مسلمان سمجھ لیا کرو۔۔۔۔ٹوٹ پھوٹ کا عمل شروع ہو چکا تھا۔تب پہلی دفعہ میں نے سوچا ،جہالت کتنی بڑی نعمت ہوتی ہے۔ہم اپنی خیالی دنیا میں کتنے آسودہ تھے۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>ایک روز ملک معراج خالد نے مجھے ایک کتاب دی اور کہا: اسے ضرور پڑھنا۔کتاب کا نام تھا\" <annotation lang=\"en\">The Myth of Independence</annotation> \"۔یہ ایک نئے بھٹو سے میرا تعارف تھا۔اس بھٹو کو تو میں جانتا ہی نہ تھا۔فیصل مسجد کے شمال میں ایک درخت تلے بیٹھ کر ایس ایم اے روؤف صاحب کی کلاس بنک کر کے میں نے یہ ساری کتاب پڑھ ڈالی۔بار بار یہ خیال آتا رہا: اگر یہ کتاب بھٹو کی ہے تو بھٹو سے نفرت کیسے کی جا سکتی ہے۔۔۔۔۔اپنا گاؤں یاد آیا۔ساتھ وہی خیال پھر آیا:جہالت کتنی بڑی نعمت ہوتی ہے۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>شریعہ اکیڈیمی کی لائبریری کھنگالتے کھنگالتے ایک روز یہ انکشاف ہوا کہ اس ملک میں شراب پر پابندی اسی اسلام دشمن بھٹو نے لگائی تھی تو میں سر پکڑ کر بیٹھ گیا۔ایک روز میرے ہاتھ پارلیمنٹ کی وہ ساری کارروائی لگ گئی جس میں قادیانیوں کو غیر مسلم قرار دیا گیا تھا۔پہلی بار مجھے علم ہوا یہ کام بھی بھٹو کے دور میں ہوا تھا۔اب کے میں نے بھٹو کو اپنی نظر سے دیکھنا شروع کر دیا۔فکری اور نظری بیساکھیاں میں نے ایک طرف پھینک دیں اور اللہ کا شکر ہے آج تک ان کا سہارا نہیں لیا۔پاکستان کے ایٹمی پروگرام پر امریکہ نے اعتراض کیا تو بطور وزیر اعظم پاکستان بھٹو نے قومی اسمبلی میں جو تقریر کی وہ ہمت حوصلہ اور ویژن کا شاہکار ہے۔آج کی دنیا میں کوئی اپوزیشن رہنما بھی اس لہجے میں امریکہ کا ذکر نہیں کر سکتا۔اتنی جرات اور اتنا ویژن۔فیض نے ٹھیک ہی تو کہا تھا:</p>\n\t\t\t<p>\" کبھی تو سوچنا یہ تم نے کیا کیا لوگو</p>\n\t\t\t<p>یہ کس کو تم نے سر دار کھو دیا لوگو\"</p>\n\t\t\t<p>وقت دھیرے دھیرے گزرتا رہا اور ایک وقت آیا صدر پاکستان نے سپریم کورٹ میں بھٹو کی پھانسی پر صدارتی ریفرنس فائل کرنے کا فیصلہ کر لیا۔وزیرقانون ڈاکٹر بابر اعوان نے اس کیس میں مجھے بھی معاون وکیل کے طور پر منتخب کرنے کا عندیہ دیا۔انکار کی گنجائش ہی نہ تھی ،میرا تو یہ دلچسپی کا موضوع تھا۔بطور معاون وکیل جب میں نے اس کیس کا مطالعہ کرنا شروع کیا تو حیرتوں کے جہاں مجھ پر وا ہوتے گئے۔اتنا تو مجھے اندازہ تھا کہ بھٹو کے ساتھ نا انصافی ہوئی لیکن اس ناانصافی کا انداز اتنا شرمناک ہو گا اس کا میں نے کبھی تصور بھی نہیں کیا تھا۔جس جج کو بھٹو نے ترقی نہیں دی تھی وہ ناراض ہو کر رخصت پر بیرون ملک چلا جاتا ہے ، اس دوران ملک میں مارشل لاء لگتا ہے۔اسی جج کو بلا کر چیف جسٹس بنا دیا جاتا ہے۔وہ جج نجی محفلوں میں کہتا ہے بھٹو کو چھوڑوں گا نہیں۔بار ایسوسی ایشنز سے خطاب کرتا ہے تو کہتا ہے سوچ کر ووٹ دیا کرو ورنہ تم پر بھٹو جیسے لوگ مسلط ہوتے رہیں گے۔تعصب اور نفرت صاف عیاں ہے۔بھٹو درخواست کرتے ہیں آپ متعصب ہیں اس لیے یہ کیس نہ سنیں، جواب آتا ہے آپ کی درخواست مل گئی پہلے کیس کا فیصلہ کر لیں پھر آپ کی درخواست کو بھی دیکھ لیں گے۔بار بار منصب انصاف سے ارشاد ہوتا ہے تم سمجھتے کیا ہو خود کو؟سیلن زدہ کوٹھری میں بھٹو کو سانس کی تکلیف ہو جاتی ہے۔درخواست آتی ہے سماعت ملتوی کر دی جائے، سرکاری ڈاکٹر بھی کہتا ہے ان کی طبیعت ٹھیک نہیں ، اس کے باوجود شنوائی نہیں ہوتی۔جو جج بھٹو کی ضمانت لیتے ہیں ان کا وہ حشر کیا جاتا ہے کہ وہ افغانستان کے راستے ملک سے فرار ہو جاتے ہیں۔جس نے شراب پر پابندی لگائی، جس نے قادیانیوں کو کافر قرار دیا اسے عدالت نام کا مسلمان کہتی ہے۔بھٹو اس پر احتجاج کرتے ہیں لیکن عدالت اپنے الفاظ پر نادم نہیں ہوتی۔قتل کے بعد اس کی لاش کو برہنہ کر کے تصویر اتار کر ضیاء الحق کو دکھائی جاتی ہے تا کہ وہ تسلی کر سکے بھٹو کافر تھا یا مسلمان۔امیر المومنین کی تسلی تو ہوئی یا نہیں معلوم نہیں لیکن تقدیر کا جبر دیکھیے مردہ بھٹو بھی ضیاء کے ساتھ کیا کر گیا۔بھٹو کا ڈیتھ

After the 80-hour workweek was implemented, the education curriculum most often consisted of didactic sessions by attending (100%), mock orals (88%), and simulation laboratories (75%). No difference was observed in ABSITE scores and first-time pass rates of the ABS examination before or after the introduction of the 80-hour workweek (20% response). Only 25% of programs felt that surgical education was improved after the implementation of the 80-hour workweek, whereas 31% felt education was worse. Overall, 44% of respondents believed that there was no difference in surgical education.']",

From patient medical records, we extracted demographic data, clinical measurements, and outcomes during emergency department evaluation and subsequent hospitalization. Data regarding serum sickness were not collected.', 'Primary outcome variables were the occurrence of immediate hypersensitivity reaction to antivenin, the type of reaction, permanent disability at hospital discharge, and mortality.', 'We identified a total of 73 patients with rattlesnake bites during the study period. Bite envenomation was graded as nonenvenomated, 7 patients (10%); mild, 23 patients (32%); moderate, 32 patients (44%); and severe, 11 patients (15%). We identified 65 patients who received antivenin. Antivenin doses ranged from 1 to 30 vials per patient (mean, 12.0 +/- 6.0), for a total of 777 vials. In 43 patients (66%), 10 or more vials of antivenin were given. The mean number of vials of antivenin given to each snakebite grade were as follows: mild, 8.4 (+/-4.0); moderate, 11.8 (+/-5.7); and severe, 18.7 (+/-6.3). No deaths, amputations, or permanent disability from snakebite occurred in the patients receiving antivenin. Acute side effects of antivenin-occurring within the first 6 hours after administration-were seen in 12 patients (18%; 95% confidence interval, 10%-30%). Acute side effects consisted solely of urticaria in all but 1 patient (2%; 95% confidence interval, 0%-8%).

This study investigated whether or not DW images offer additional incremental value to conventional nonenhanced MR imaging in comparison with histopathological results. Moreover, the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were measured in the regions of interest within the endometrial cancer and compared with those of normal endometrium and myometrium in 31 volunteers, leiomyoma in 14 patients and adenomyosis in 10 patients. The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used, with a p<0.05 considered statistically significant.', 'In 19 of 23 patients, endometrial cancers were detected only on T2-weighted images. In the remaining 4 patients, of whom two had coexisting leiomyoma, no cancer was detected on T2-weighted images. This corresponds to an 83% detection sensitivity for the carcinomas. When DW images and fused DW images/T2-weighted images were used in addition to the T2-weighted images, cancers were identified in 3 of the remaining 4 patients in addition to the 19 patients (overall detection sensitivity of 96%). The mean ADC value of endometrial cancer (n=22) was (0.97+/-0.19)x10(-3)mm(2)/s, which was significantly lower than those of the normal endometrium, myometrium, leiomyoma and adenomyosis (p<0.05).']",

Variables were compared using chi-square tests.', 'All children were skeletally immature. Condylar lesions were medial in 24 knees and lateral in six knees.

Only a few studies have examined the effect of personality traits on survival, such as optimism. The aim of this study was to examine whether an optimistic outlook predicts survival among the oldest-old.', 'The Danish 1905 Cohort Survey is a nationwide, longitudinal survey comprising all individuals born in Denmark in 1905. At baseline in 1998, a total of 2,262 persons aged 92 or 93 agreed to participate in the intake survey. The baseline in-person interview consisted of a comprehensive questionnaire including physical functioning and health, and a question about whether the respondent had an optimistic, neutral or pessimistic outlook on his or her own future.', 'During the follow-up period of 12 years (1998-2010) there were 2,239 deaths (99 %) in the 1905 Cohort Survey. Univariable analyses revealed that optimistic women and men were at lower risk of death compared to their neutral counterparts [HR 0.82, 95 % CI (0.73-0.93) and 0.81, 95 % CI (0.66-0.99), respectively]. When confounding factors such as baseline physical and cognitive functioning and disease were taken into account the association between optimism and survival weakened in both sexes, but the general pattern persisted. Optimistic women were still at lower risk of death compared to neutral women [HR 0.85, 95 % CI (0.74-0.97)]. The risk of death was also decreased for optimistic men compared to their neutral counterparts, but the effect was non-significant [HR 0.91, 95 % CI (0.73-1.13)].']",

        "document_str": "\nEs ist nur Alzheimer und nicht die verdammte Pest!Ein Freund hat kürzlich zu mir gesagt: \"Als meine Freunde gehört haben, dass ich Alzheimer habe, schauten mich viele an, als ob ich eine ansteckende Krankheit hätte. Dann hörten sie einfach auf anzurufen oder vorbeizukommen. Verstehen die denn nicht, dass es sich hier nicht um die verdammte Pest handelt?\"Was es nicht istIch habe acht Jahre mit Menschen verbracht die sich in verschiedenen Stadien von Alzheimer oder anderen Arten von Demenz  befanden. Obwohl meine Hospiz -Patienten in San Francisco sich alle in den späteren Stadien befanden, habe ich doch schmerzhafte Erzählungen von ihren Familien darüber gehört, wie ihre Mitmenschen auf sie reagiert haben, als sie noch in der Lage waren mit ein wenig Hilfe zu funktionieren.Von anderen, die sich ebenfalls in den Frühstadien befanden, wurden mir die gleichen Erfahrungen berichtet über Verwandte, alte Freunden und gute Kollegen, die sich nach und nach abgewandt haben oder  sie behandelt hätten als ob sie:- Zurück in ihre Kindheit versetzt worden sind- Die Fähigkeiten eines zurückgebliebenen Kindes besaßen- Psychotisch geworden sindNichts davon stimmt und trotzdem behandeln wir als Gesellschaft Menschen mit Demenz so, als wenn wenigsten einer dieser Irrtümer das Evangelium wäre. Der Schaden, den wir anrichtenWenn wir aus Unwissenheit heraus handeln, können wir unbeabsichtigt unglaublichen Schaden bei den Menschen anrichten, die mit der Krankheit kämpfen. Zum  Beispiel hat ein Betroffener mit  Demenz, der einen Doktor in Chemie besaß, aufgehört sich Essen in einem Schnellrestaurant zu bestellen. Er sagt: \"Der Kassierer hat mir das Gefühl gegeben ein Idiot zu sein,\" als er nicht in der Lage war sich schnell genug zu entscheiden, was er aus einem Angebot von 50 Artikeln, die man auf vielfache Weise kombinieren konnte, bestellen wollte.Veränderte IdentitätenWenn Erinnerungen verloren gehen und es immer schwerer wird die Erinnerungen, die einem noch bleiben, zu sortieren, verändert sich die Identität eines Menschen mit Demenz. Wir alle sehen uns selbst  - unsere Identität - durch die Rollen, die wir spielen, die Aktivitäten, die uns Spaß machen, die Zugehörigkeiten, die wir haben, die  Werte, die sich durch unser Leben ziehen, und durch unsere Fähigkeiten und unsere Beziehungen. Stellen Sie sich vor, wie sich Ihr Leben verändern würde, wenn wichtige Teile ihrer Identität einfach so verschwinden würden - manchmal schneller und manchmal langsamer und schlimmstenfalls so allmählich, dass sie es kaum merken. Und es sind nicht nur die eigenen Wahrnehmungen, die Identitäten schaffen, sondern auch die Eindrücke, die andere Menschen von uns haben. Stellen sie sich vor, wie sich ein Chemiker, der 8 Jahre studiert hat und an der Entwicklung  von lebensrettenden Medikamenten beteiligt war,  fühlen muss, wenn er jetzt Angst davor hat einen Hamburger bei jemanden zu bestellen, der wahrscheinlich noch nicht mal einen Schulabschluss hat. Die scharfen Spitzen zusammenziehen Das Leben steckt voller Entscheidungen. Wir können weglaufen vor Menschen mit der Krankheit, entweder aus Unwissenheit oder Angst davor, was aus uns selbst vielleicht irgendwann mal werden könnte, oder  wir können uns selbst in die Lage einer Person mit Demenz versetzen. Die Tibeter haben eine Redensart, die besagt, dass, wenn man seine Ängste überwinden will - die scharfen Spitzen - sie näher an sich herankommen lassen sollte anstatt vor ihnen davonzurennen. Aber letztendlich werden Sie nicht dazu in der Lage sein, vor Alzheimer oder anderen Formen der Demenz zu fliehen. Statistisch gesehen werden viele von denen, die diesen Artikel lesen, Demenz entwickeln. Im Alter von 60 Jahren  beträgt die Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass Sie eine Form von Demenz entwickeln 1%, und  das Risiko steigt jedes Jahr bis hin zum Alter von 85 Jahren, wo es schließlich bei 35% bleibt. Wenn Sie einen Elternteil mit früh einsetzender Demenz haben, steigt Ihr Risiko, die Krankheit ebenfalls zu entwickeln dramatisch. Und wenn Sie niemanden innerhalb Ihres Bekanntenkreises kennen, der Alzheimer oder eine andere Form der Demenz hat,  glauben Sie mir, das wird sich ändern.Wie man helfen kannWenn man Demenz hat, ist es in vielerlei Hinsicht so, als wäre man in einem fremden Land gestrandet, wo Bräuche herrschen und eine Sprache gesprochen wird, die man nicht versteht. Und gerade, wenn man gelernt hat, sich zurechtzufinden, ändert sich etwas, und man muss wieder von vorne anfangen. Und niemand ist da, der einem ein GPS gibt, um den Weg zu finden.Wie  würden Sie reagieren, wenn es Ihr Ehepartner, ein Elternteil oder ein Freund wären, die Demenz haben? Anstatt eine Reihe von \"Sie sollten/Sie sollten nicht\"-Regeln aufzustellen oder in spezifischen Details der Alzheimer- und Demenzerkrankung zu versinken (siehe Link oben), dachte ich mir, ich schlage Ihnen ein paar Dinge vor, die Sie bedenken sollten, wenn Sie das nächste mal mit einen Menschen zu tun haben, der Demenz hat oder von dem sie glauben, dass er Demenz hat.Haben Sie Geduld, bei Menschen mit Demenz kann es länger dauern, Informationen zu verarbeiten. Erinnerungen werden nicht mit Absicht verloren. Es gibt Dinge, an die sich jemand mit Demenz einfach nicht erinnern kann, egal ob sie  erst kürzlich geschehen sind oder schon länger zurückliegen. Das bedeutet nicht, dass er nicht versucht, sich zu erinnern. Akzeptieren Sie Veränderungen. Demenz ist eine fortschreitende Krankheit. Die Fähigkeiten einer Person können morgen ganz anders sein als heute.Bieten Sie der Person Hilfe an. Es gibt nur wenige Dinge, die so viel Angst machen, als wenn man orientierungslos ist, zum Beispiel, wenn man sich nur wenige Straßen von seinem Haus befindet, aber den Weg nicht weiß. Wenn Sie jemanden sehen, der eindeutig verwirrt ist, trauen Sie sich ruhig, Ihre Hilfe anzubieten. Das Schlimmste, was passieren kann, ist das Sie ein \"Nein, danke\" hören. Das Beste, was passieren kann, ist das Sie einem anderen Menschen einen großen Gefallen erweisen.Bieten Sie dem Betreuer Hilfe an. Wenn jemand noch nie als Langzeit-Pflegekraft tätig war, ist er sich meistens nicht darüber bewusst, wie anstrengend es sein kann. Bieten Sie Hilfe an. Alles wird dankbar aufgenommen werden. Zu wissen, dass es doch Menschen gibt, die sich ebenfalls sorgen, ist ein richtiger Segen und jeder der so ein Angebot erhält, würde, wie meine Mutter sagen würde, einen \"mitzvah\" für jede Person sagen, die ihre Hilfe anbietet.  Betroffene leben in einer anderen Welt. Wie bei jeder chronischen oder finalen Krankheit wird fast alles durch den Wahrnehmungsfilter der Krankheit gesehen, von jeglichen Geräuschen bis hin zu den frustrierten Blicken des Kassierers im Schnellrestaurant.Seien Sie mitfühlend. Stellen Sie sich vor, dass die Person mit Demenz ein Elternteil von Ihnen ist, den Sie sehr lieben. Wie würden Sie wollen, dass andere Menschen mit ihm umgehen und, was noch viel wichtiger ist, welches Gefühl sollten diese Menschen nach ihrer Interaktion mit Ihnen haben?Geben Sie ihnen das Beste mit auf den Weg,  was sie ihnen geben könnenEs stimmt, dass die Person die Sie als gesellig gekannt haben, sich letztendlich so in sich selber zurückziehen wird, dass Sie kaum noch dazu in der Lage sein werden, eine Verbindung mit ihr herzustellen. Aber solch eine Situation kann noch Jahre entfernt sein. Genießen Sie ihre Anwesenheit, solange Sie noch können, und bieten Sie ihnen die Unterstützung und das Mitgefühl an, das Sie selber gerne hätten, wenn Sie es wären, der sich auf den Weg zu einem seltsamen, strukturlosen Ort befindet. Wir wissen nicht, was eine Person mit sich zu diesem Ort nimmt, den wir nicht betreten dürfen. Aber macht es nicht Sinn ihnen Erinnerungen mit auf den Weg zu geben, die schön sind, anstatt welcher, die es nicht sind?Stan Goldberg ist Verfasser von Lessons for the Living: Stories of Forgiveness, Gratitude, and Courage at the End of Life.

أوكما تقول والدتي \"ميتزفه على من يقدم تلك المساعدة. أنت  تعيش في عالم مختلف. و كما هي الحال مع أيّ من الأمراض المزمنة و أمراض آخر العمر،  يرى المريض كل شيء تقريبا، بمنظار إدراكه الحسيّ للمرض، من الإزعاجات إلى النظرات المحبطة لعاملي الكاشير في مطاعم الوجبات السريع.كن متعاطف. و تخيل لو كان المريض أحد والديك الذي يحبك. ما الطريقة التي كنت لترغب أن يتعامل بها الناس معه أو معها و السؤال الأهم كيف كنت لترغب أن يشعر والدك أو تشعر والدتك بعد ذلك التعامل؟دعهم يرحلون مع أفضل ما يمكنك تقديمهنعم, الشخص الذي كان ذات يوم اجتماعيا سيبدأ بالانطواء على نفسه تدريجيا إلى أن تصبح غير قادر على التواصل معه. و لكن ذلك قد يحدث بعد سنوات.لذلك تنعّم بوجوده ما دمت قادرا على ذلك و قدّم له الدعم و العطف الذين كنت لترغب بهما لو أنك كنت تمشي ببطء في طريق أحادي يؤدي إلى مكان غريب لا معالم له.لا نعلم ماذا يأخذ المصاب بالاختلال العقلي معه إلى ذلك المكان الذي لا يسمح لنا بدخوله. ولكن أليس من الأفضل أن نقدّم لهم ذكريات طيبة لا ذكريات سيئة؟ستان غولدبيرغ هو مؤلف كتاب دروس في العيش: قصص عن التسامح و الامتنان و الشجاعة في نهاية الحياة. الذي حاز على ستة جوائز محلية و عالمية. و سيتم إصدار كتابه الجديد الاتكاء على النقاط الحادّة: دليل عملي و دعم تربوي لمقدّمي الرعاية عن دار نيو وورلد لايبراري في آذار\\مارس 2012 .   *العنوان الإنجليزي: Lessons for the Living: Stories of Forgiveness, Gratitude, and Courage at the End of Life**العنوان الإنجليزي: Leaning Into Sharp Points: Practical Guidance and Nurturing Support for Caregivers\n\t\t\t",

Analyses using multivariable models, controlling for potential confounders and stratifying on propensity score, were performed.', 'Compared with nonanemic patients, those with severe, moderate, and mild anemia were more likely to have the adverse CO with odds ratios of 1.83 (95% CI 1.05 to 3.19), 2.19 (95 % CI 1.63 to 2.94), and 1.49 (95% CI 1.20 to 1.86), respectively.

Immediately after the reperfusion period, both ovaries were excised for histological scoring, caspase-3 immunohistochemistry and biochemical evaluation including glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. Also, total antioxidant capacity (TAC) was measured in plasma samples to evaluate the antioxidant effect of edaravone.', 'Ovarian sections in the saline group revealed higher scores for follicular degeneration and edema (p<0.0001) when compared with the sham group. Administration of different doses of edaravone in rats significantly prevented degenerative changes in the ovary (p<0.0001). Caspase-3 expression was only detected in the ovarian surface epithelium in all groups, and there was a significant difference between the treatment groups and the saline group (p<0.0001). Treatment of rats with edaravone reduced caspase-3 expression in a dose-dependent manner.

The aim of this study was to develop a new BMR prediction equation for Chinese adults applicable for a large BMI range and compare it with commonly used prediction equations.', 'Subjects were 121 men and 111 women (age: 21-67 years, BMI: 16-41\\xa0kg/m(2)).

The aim of this pilot study was to determine whether an instruction manual consisting of four diagrams enables laypersons to operate a Laryngeal Mask Supreme® (LMAS) in the manikin.', 'An instruction manual of four illustrations with speech bubbles displaying the correct use of the LMAS was designed. Laypersons were handed a bag containing a LMAS, a bag mask valve device (BMV), a syringe prefilled with air and the instruction sheet, and were asked to perform and ventilate the manikin as displayed. Time to ventilation was recorded and degree of success evaluated.', 'A total of 150 laypersons took part. Overall 145 participants (96.7%) inserted the LMAS in the manikin in the right direction. The device was inserted inverted or twisted in 13 (8.7%) attempts. Eight (5.3%) individuals recognized this and corrected the position. Within the first 2 minutes 119 (79.3%) applicants were able to insert the LMAS and provide tidal volumes greater than 150 ml (estimated dead space). Time to insertion and first ventilation was 83.2 ± 29 s. No significant difference related to previous BLS training (P = 0.85), technical education (P = 0.07) or gender could be demonstrated (P = 0.25).']",

AGE research in uremia has focused on the accumulation of carbohydrate-derived adducts generated by the Maillard reaction. Recent studies, however, have demonstrated that one AGE, the glycoxidation product carboxymethyllysine (CML), could be derived not only from carbohydrates but also from oxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids in vitro, raising the possibility that both carbohydrate and lipid autoxidation might be increased in uremia.', 'To address this hypothesis, we applied gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and high performance liquid chromatography to measure protein adducts formed in uremic plasma by reactions between carbonyl compounds and protein amino groups: pentosidine derived from carbohydrate-derived carbonyls, malondialdehyde (MDA)-lysine derived from lipid-derived carbonyls, and CML originating possibly from both sources.', 'All three adducts were elevated in uremic plasma. Plasma CML levels were mainly (>95%) albumin bound. Their levels were not correlated with fructoselysine levels and were similar in diabetic and non-diabetic patients on hemodialysis, indicating that their increase was not driven by glucose. Pentosidine and MDA-lysine were also increased in plasma to the same extent in diabetic and non-diabetic hemodialysis patients. Statistical analysis indicated that plasma levels of CML correlated weakly (P<0.05) with those of pentosidine and MDA-lysine, but that pentosidine and MDA-lysine varied independently (P>0.5).']",

The most common reason for an office visit in both populations was an undifferentiated symptom. Fifteen of the top 20 \"reason for visit\" codes were identical, as were 14 of the top 20 diagnoses. More preventive and therapeutic services were offered or performed at our residency training sites but fewer diagnostic services were performed. There were fewer consultations requested at our residency training sites but similar hospitalization rates for patients. The mean duration of visit differed by only 1 minute.']",

It has yet to be shown whether there is an outcome benefit associated with the \"level of hospital\" initially treating severely injured trauma patients in Australia. This study was designed to determine whether the level of trauma center providing treatment impacts mortality and/or hospital length of stay.', 'Outcomes were evaluated for severely injured trauma patients with an Injury Severity Score (ISS)>15 using NSW Institute of Trauma and Injury Management data from 2002-2007 for our regional health service.

To assess the association between trauma centers and continuous outcomes, a multivariable linear regression model was used. Sex, age, and ISS were included as covariates in all models.', 'There were 1,986 trauma presentations during the 6-year period. Patients presenting to a level III trauma center had a significantly higher risk of death than those presenting to the level I center, regardless of age, sex, ISS, or prehospital time.

Moreover, pWAT produces these chemokines, as shown by immunohistochemistry and by explant culture. The accumulation of macrophages and T cells at the interface between pWAT and the adventitia of human atherosclerotic aortas may reflect this prochemotactic activity of pWAT.']",

Clinical characteristics; echocardiographic right ventricular dysfunction; inhospital mortality; and adverse clinical events including need for inotropic support, mechanical ventilation, and thrombolysis were compared in patients with elevated cTnI levels vs patients with normal cTnI levels. One hundred sixteen patients with PE were identified, and 77 of them (66%) were included in the study. Thirty-three patients (42%) had elevated cTnI levels. Elevated cTnI levels were associated with inhospital mortality (P = .02), complicated clinical course (P<.001), and right ventricular dysfunction (P<.001). In patients with elevated cTnI levels, inhospital mortality (odds ratio [OR], 3.31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.82-9.29), hypotension (OR, 7.37; 95% CI, 2.31-23.28), thrombolysis (OR, 5.71; 95% CI, 1.63-19.92), need for mechanical ventilation (OR, 5.00; 95% CI, 1.42-17.57), and need for inotropic support (OR, 3.02; 95% CI, 1.03-8.85) were more prevalent.

The lace plant (Aponogeton madagascariensis) produces perforations in its leaves through PCD. The leaves of the plant consist of a latticework of longitudinal and transverse veins enclosing areoles. PCD occurs in the cells at the center of these areoles and progresses outwards, stopping approximately five cells from the vasculature. The role of mitochondria during PCD has been recognized in animals; however, it has been less studied during PCD in plants.', 'The following paper elucidates the role of mitochondrial dynamics during developmentally regulated PCD in vivo in A. madagascariensis. A single areole within a window stage leaf (PCD is occurring) was divided into three areas based on the progression of PCD; cells that will not undergo PCD (NPCD), cells in early stages of PCD (EPCD), and cells in late stages of PCD (LPCD). Window stage leaves were stained with the mitochondrial dye MitoTracker Red CMXRos and examined. Mitochondrial dynamics were delineated into four categories (M1-M4) based on characteristics including distribution, motility, and membrane potential (ΔΨm). A TUNEL assay showed fragmented nDNA in a gradient over these mitochondrial stages. Chloroplasts and transvacuolar strands were also examined using live cell imaging. The possible importance of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP) formation during PCD was indirectly examined via in vivo cyclosporine A (CsA) treatment. This treatment resulted in lace plant leaves with a significantly lower number of perforations compared to controls, and that displayed mitochondrial dynamics similar to that of non-PCD cells.']",

Recently, it has been shown to regulate circadian clocks. In seasonal breeding species such as sheep, the circadian clock controls the secretion of an endogenous rhythm of melatonin and, as a consequence, is probably involved in the generation of seasonal rhythms of reproduction. Considering this, we identified the presence of the subunits of AMPK in different hypothalamic nuclei involved in the pre- and post-pineal pathways that control seasonality of reproduction in the ewe and we investigated if the intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of two activators of AMPK, metformin and AICAR, affected the circadian rhythm of melatonin in ewes that were housed in constant darkness. In parallel the secretion of insulin was monitored as a peripheral metabolic marker. We also investigated the effects of i.c.v. AICAR on the phosphorylation of AMPK and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), a downstream target of AMPK, in brain structures along the photoneuroendocrine pathway to the pineal gland.', 'All the subunits of AMPK that we studied were identified in all brain areas that were dissected but with some differences in their level of expression among structures. Metformin and AICAR both reduced (p<0.001 and p<0.01 respectively) the amplitude of the circadian rhythm of melatonin secretion independently of insulin secretion. The i.c.v. injection of AICAR only tended (p = 0.1) to increase the levels of phosphorylated AMPK in the paraventricular nucleus but significantly increased the levels of phosphorylated ACC in the paraventricular nucleus (p<0.001) and in the pineal gland (p<0.05).']",

جبکہ بیٹے، بھائی اور شوہر شہزادے ہوتے ہیں۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>ماں کی بیتے کے لیے تکالیف کی کہانی بیٹے کے دنیا میں آنے سے پہلے ہی شروع ہوتی ہے اور یہی ماں اپنی آخری سانس تک بیٹے کی آرام دہ زندگی کے لیے تڑپتی رہتی ہے۔ اسی طرح بیوی اپنی زندگی کو اپنے خاوند کے حوالے کر دیتی ہے، دکھ سکھ، غمی خوشی، ہر مشکل اور مصیبت سہنے کے لیے تیار رہتی ہے، اس کے لیے بے پناہ قربانیوں پیش کرتی ہیں !!</p>\n\t\t\t<p>یہ تو ہو گئی گھر کی مختصر کہانی!!! اب سماج میں عورت کے ساتھ کیا برتاؤ کیا جاتا ہے، اس کو ذرا دیکھتے ہیں۔ ماؤں کو اپنی بیٹیوں کے بارے میں یہ خوف ہر وقت ستاتا رہتا ہے کہ اُن پر کسی سنگ دل مرد کی بے شرمانہ نظریں نہ پڑیں۔ سماج میں روز پیش آنے والی اور ذرائع ابلاغ پر دکھائی جانے والی دل خراش کہانیوں اور واقعات کو دیکھ کر ماں ہر وقت اسی اضطراب کے ماحول میں اپنے دن رات گزارتی ہے کہ کہیں یہی خبریں میری آنگن سے نہ نکلیں!!!!</p>\n\t\t\t<p>لڑکوں کی دھوکہ دہی، استحصال، بلیک میلنگ اور شادی اور دوستی کے جھوٹے وعدوں کے شکار ہونے والی لڑکیاں نہ اپنے گھر کی رہ جاتی ہیں اور نہ ہی انہیں سماج قبول کرتا ہے۔ اُسے ناقص العقل، بے وقوف اور طرح طرح کے طعنوں کا سامنا کرنا پڑتا ہے۔ اب تو کوئے یار میں ایسی کسی ملزم اور مقتول کے لیے دو گز زمین بھی میسر نہ رہی۔ ۔ لیکن اصل مجرموں ( عفت ریزی اور عصمت دری کرنے والوں) کو گھر میں بھی قبول اور سماج میں بھی انہیں ہیروز کے طور پر پیش کیا جاتا ہے۔ ان کے گرد لڑکے جمع ہو کر کہنے لگتے ہیں \"سانوں وی دسو یار کہ کڑیاں نوں کیویں پھنسانا ہے؟ (ہمیں بھی بتاﺅ کہ لڑکیوں کو کیسے زیر دام لاتے ہیں) وہ پھر بڑے احساس تفاخر سے اپنی فاتحانہ کرتوت سنانے لگتے ہیں۔ کسی کی بیٹی یا بہن کی عصمت دری کی قصہ خوانی کے دوران نہ سننے والوں میں شرم اور نہ سنانے والوں میں حیا کی کوئی رمق!</p>\n\t\t\t<p>ہمارا سماج بھی ایک مردانہ سماج ہے جہاں ہر طرح کی اخلاقی، مذہبی اور سماجی فوقت مرد کو ہی حاصل ہے جبکہ عورت کمزور، لاچار، بے آسرا اور بے بس اور مرد کی خدمت گار مخلوق کی حیثیت رکھتی ہے۔ ان کی بے بسی کی دل سوز کہانیاں بیٹی، بہن، بیوی اور ماں کے مختلف روپ اور کرداروں میں آپ روزانہ سن اور دیکھ سکتے ہیں۔ تہمینہ کی کہانی کی طرح آبرو ریزی کی کہانیاں آپ کو اپنے ہی اطراف میں ملیں گی۔</p>\n\t\t\t<heading>خداوندان سماج سے میرے دس سوالات ہیں:</heading>\n\t\t\t<heading>1. کیوں مرد (بیٹا، بھائی، شوہر) ہونے پر احساس برتری ہوتا ہے اور عورت (بیٹی، بہن اور بیوی) ہونے پر احساس کم تری؟ کیا ہمارے سماج میں صنف ہی احساس برتری جتلانے کا ذریعہ قرار پائی ہے؟</heading>\n\t\t\t<p>2. گھریلو تنازعات سے لے کر سماجی برائیوں تک کیوں ہر سماجی برائی، فتنہ فساد، جھگڑے اور لڑائی میں کوئی ہاتھ ہو نہ ہو، ذمہ دار عورت کو ہی ٹھہرایا جاتا ہے؟</p>\n\t\t\t<heading>3. مرد کے دھوکے، للچائی نظروں، جھوٹے وعدوں اور جنسی جرائم کو سماجی قبولیت کیوں حاصل ہے جبکہ عورت کے چہرہ اور کلائیوں اور پنڈلیوں کے نظر آنے پر ہر دم سماجی و مذہبی فتاوی کی بھرمار؟</heading>\n\t\t\t<p>4 حیا، غیرت اور عفت وغیرہ کے عناوین صرف عورت کے ساتھ کیوں مختص کیے گئے ہیں؟ اس اخلاقی تفریق کا جواز کیا ہے؟ کیوں اخلاقی معیارات پر مرد کو برتری دی گئی ہے؟ مرد کی جابرانہ بے حیائی چھوٹی اور عورت پر ہونے والی زیادتی بھی عورت ہی کے لیے سماجی بے قدری کی وعید!!! مرد کا گنا ہ چھوٹا اور عورت کا گنا ہ بڑا کیوں اور کیسے ہے؟ کیوں مرد عورت پر زیادتی کے بعد ہیرو قرار پاتے ہیں اور عورت ایک بالجبر گناہ کے بعد زندگی بھر کے لیے آنکھ اٹھا کر چلنے سے بھی قاصر ہو جاتی ہے؟</p>\n\t\t\t<heading>5. عورت بالغہ اور رشید ہ ہونے کے باوجود بہت سے نجی، گھریلو اور سماجی معاملات میں وہ اپنی بہتری کا فیصلہ کیوں نہیں کر سکتی ہے ؟ تعلیمی کیرئیر، ملازمت کے مواقع اور شوہر کے انتخاب وغیرہ جیسے بنیادی اور فیصلہ کن مراحل میں کیوں اسے مرد کے فیصلے (چاہے اسے وہ پسند ہوں یا نہ ہوں، بہتر ہوں یا نہ ہوں) کو ہی قبول کرنا پڑتا ہے؟</heading>\n\t\t\t<p>6. عورت پر یہ اصرار کیوں کہ وہ صرف اپنے گھر میں ہی کام کر سکتی ہے؟ اسے اعلیٰ تعلیم و تربیت اور مختلف شعبہ ہائے زندگی میں آگے بڑھنے سے کیوں روکا جاتا ہے؟ اسے کیوں روایت سے بغاوت کرنے پر مجبور ہونا پڑتا ہے؟ کیوں سماج کی تعمیر و ترقی میں عورتوں کو عضو معطل کی طرح سمجھا گیا ہے؟</p>\n\t\t\t<heading>7. عورتوں کی آبادی مردوں کی آبادی سے زیادہ ہونے کے باوجود تعلیمی و تر بیتی ادارے اور سماجی مراکز مرد اور خواتین کے لیے یکساں کیوں نہیں ہیں؟۔ کیوں شہر میں لڑکوں کے بیس سکول اور کالجز اور لڑکیوں کے دو سکو ل اور کالجز ہوتے ہیں؟ کیوں اکیاون فیصد آبادی پر مشتمل خواتین کو ریاستی اور سماجی اداروں میں نمائندگی تیس فیصد بھی نہیں ہے؟</heading>\n\t\t\t<p>8. دین کی تشریح اور بیان میں خواتین کا تناظر ادارتی سطح پر مورد نظر کیوں نہیں ہے؟ کیا دین کے مختلف پہلوؤں کی تفہیم و تشریح کے جملہ حقوق صرف مردوں کے لیے خاص ہیں؟</p>\n\t\t\t<heading>9. کیوں مذہب، قانون، ریاست، عدالت ، میڈیا سب کمزوروں کی غلطیاں نکالنے ، انہی پر ہی اپنا دباؤ رکھنے اور انہی کو ہی ہر معاملے میں غلط ٹھہرانے پر لگے ہوئے ہیں؟</heading>\n\t\t\t<p>10. خواتین کے معاشی، سماجی اور انسانی حقوق پر بات کرنا کیوں مغربی ایجنڈا قرار دیا جاتا ہے؟ کیا مشرقی تہذیب یا اسلام میں عورت کے حقوق اور مقام کا کوئی عملی تصور نہیں ہے؟ ہم کب تک عورت کے کتابی حقوق اور مقام کی مدح سرائی میں زمینی حقائق سے منہ چراتے پھریں گے؟</p>\n\t\t\t<p>ہمارے سماج کی ہمہ جہت تعمیر و ترقی کے لیے ضروری ہے کہ کسی خوف و ہراس، صنفی تعصب و تشدد کے بغیر زندگی کے مختلف شعبوں میں مرد و عورت کو اپنے اپنے فرائض سر انجام دینے کے یکساں نہیں تو کم از کم متناسب مواقع اور وسائل دستیاب ہوں۔ اس مقصد کے لیے سماج میں ایسے متوازن رویے پروان چڑھانے کی ضرورت ہے جو ٹھوس اخلاقی بنیادوں پر استوار ہو۔</p>\n\t\t</section>\n\t</body>\n"

Secretin stimulation allows endoscopic collection of pancreatic juice secreted into the duodenum. We aimed to evaluate the cytokine concentrations in pancreatic juice of patients with abdominal pain to discriminate presence from absence of pancreatic disease.', 'From January 2003-December 2004, consecutive patients with abdominal pain compatible with pancreatic origin were enrolled. Patients underwent upper endoscopy. Intravenous secretin (0.2 mug/kg) was given immediately before scope intubation. Pancreatic juice collected from the duodenum was immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen until assays were performed. Pancreatic juice levels of interleukin-8, interleukin-6, intercellular adhesion molecule 1, and transforming growth factor-beta 1 were measured by modified enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The final diagnosis was made by the primary gastroenterologist on the basis of medical history; laboratory, endoscopic, and imaging studies; and clinical follow-up. Fisher exact test and Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test were used for statistical analysis.', 'Of 130 patients screened, 118 met the inclusion criteria. Multivariate analysis revealed that only interleukin-8 was able to discriminate between normal pancreas and chronic pancreatitis (P = .011), pancreatic cancer (P = .044), and the presence of pancreatic diseases (P = .007). Individual cytokine concentrations were not significantly different in chronic pancreatitis compared with pancreatic cancer.']",

Controls were identified by random digit dialing and frequency matched by age. Use of digoxin was determined from in-person questionnaires regarding medical and prescription history. The relationship of digoxin use with PCa risk was evaluated with logistic regression.', 'One thousand one cases of PCa and 942 controls were analyzed. The prevalence of digoxin use in controls was 2.7%, and use was positively correlated with age.

In group E, bursting pressures and hydroxyproline levels were determined on the second postoperative day, whereas in group L, the same measurements were made on the sixth postoperative day. One-way analysis of variance was used for analyses of variance in the groups. Quantitative data were analyzed with Student's t test. P value was considered significant at less than .05.\", 'There was no significant difference between bursting pressures of subgroup pairs on both postoperative days 2 and 6. Hydroxyproline levels and AT were significantly better in B subgroups.']",

دنوں بہت ذکر ہو رہا ہے اس جھگڑے کا جو اسلامی نظریاتی کونسل کے حالیہ اجلاس کے دوران مولانا طاہر اشرفی اور مولانا شیرانی کے مابین ہوا۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>ذرا غور کریں تو فوراََ خبر ہو جاتی ہے کہ اس مسئلے کو اچھالنے کی ترغیب ہمارے اداس دلوں میں مچلتی وہ تمنا دے رہی ہے جو دوسروں کی طشت ازبام ہوئی خامیوں سے لطف اٹھانا چاہتی ہے۔ چسکے اور چیزے لینے کو بے تاب ذہن جو سوچنے کی نعمت سے مکمل طور پر محروم ہو چکے ہیں۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>مولانا شیرانی کو میں حافظ طاہر اشرفی سے کئی برس قبل ملا تھا۔ پارلیمان کی کارروائی پر کالم لکھتے ہوئے اکثر ان سے رجوع کرنے پر مجبور ہوا۔ اپنی تمام تر متانت اور شائستگی کے باوجود مجھے ہمیشہ زاہدِ خشک ہی محسوس ہوئے۔ کوئٹہ جانے کا جب بھی موقعہ ملے تو ان کے بارے میں بہت کچھ سننے کو ملتا ہے۔ بہت لوگ بے تحاشہ تعریف بھی کرتے ہیں اور انہیں ایک ایسے عالم کے طور پر پیش کرتے ہیں جو بلوچستان کے مخصوص ماحول میں ہمارے برادر ممالک کی بھڑکائی فرقہ وارانہ آگ کو کسی نہ کسی طرح بجھانے کی کوششیں کرتے رہتے ہیں۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>مولانا کے مخالفین ان کی بدخوئی کا آغاز ان کے والد کے ذکر سے کرتے ہیں اور پھر رُکنے کا نام ہی نہیں لیتے۔ کسی شخص کے بارے میں اچھی اور بُری کہانیاں سننے کے بعد حتمی رائے دینے کا مجھے کوئی شوق نہیں۔ اپنے گریبان ہی میں جھانکتے رہنے کی عادت کے ہاتھوں مجبور ہوں۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>طاہر اشرفی کا تعلق چونکہ لاہور سے ہے اس لئے پہلی ملاقات کے ساتھ ہی کافی بے تکلفی بھی ہو گئی۔ اب وہ مقامی ہی نہیں عالمی سطح پر بھی بہت مشہور ہو گئے ہیں۔ ان تک دسترس بھی میرے جیسے عامی کے لئے اب مشکل ہوتی جا رہی ہے۔ ربّ کریم انہیں مزید کامیاب کرے تاکہ اپنی دبنگ شخصیت سے ہماری سکرینوں پر رونق لگائے رکھیں۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>ایک اخباری رپورٹر میں جبلی طور پر موجود تجسس کی طاقت وقوت سے میں بتدریج محروم ہوتا جا رہا ہوں۔ جھگڑا چونکہ اسلام آباد میں ہوا تھا اس لئے ایک دو لوگوں سے ملاقاتیں اور چند فون کرنے کے بعد معلوم کیا جاسکتا ہے کہ اصل واقعہ کیا تھا اور دو مولانا حضرات کے درمیان ہوئے تماشے کا ذمہ دار کون ہے۔ ان دنوں اپنے دل پر چھائی مُردنی کی وجہ سے مگر اس ضمن میں خواہش ہی پیدا نہیں ہو رہی۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>جس حقیقت نے مگر دل دہلا دیا ہے وہ اس اجلاس کا جہاں یہ جھگڑا ہوا مبینہ طور پر مجوزہ ایجنڈا ہے۔ مسلمان اور مرتد کے درمیان فرق کے معاملے پر میں گنہگار ایک لفظ لکھنے کی جرأت بھی نہیں دکھا پائوں گا۔ قطعی لاشعوری طور پر کوئی خطا ہو گئی تو کفر کے فتوے آجائیں گے۔ مولانا حضرات کے پاس ان دنوں مساجد کے منبر اور لائوڈ سپیکر ہی نہیں، چند جاں نثار \"کن ٹُٹے\" بھی ہوا کرتے ہیں۔ پولیس کسی شخص کے خلاف ان کی لکھوائی رپٹ کو فوراََ باقاعدہ چالان کی صورت بھی فراہم کر دیتی ہے۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>میں تو گھر کے ایک کونے میں دبکا دو ٹکے کا رپورٹر ہوں مگر ایک انتہائی طاقت ور شخص چودھری نثار علی خان بھی ہوتے ہیں۔ راولپنڈی کے نواح میں واقعہ چکری کے نامی گرامی پیال راجپوت گھرانے سے ان کا تعلق ہے۔ اس گھرانے کے اثر کا اعتراف برطانوی دور میں لکھے <annotation lang=\"en\">Gazetteers</annotation> میں بھی ہوا ہے۔ 1985ء سے مسلسل قومی اسمبلی کے رکن چلے آرہے ہیں۔ نواز شریف کی ہر حکومت میں انہیں ان کا سب سے طاقت ور وزیر تسلیم کیا جاتا ہے۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>یہ چودھری نثار مگر لال مسجد کے مولانا عزیز کے حوالے سے قطعی بے بس نظر آتے ہیں۔ گزشتہ تین جمعے انہوں نے اسلام آباد میں موبائل فونز بند کروائے۔ وجہ اس کی صرف یہ تھی کہ مولانا عزیز لال مسجد جا کر پاکستان میں شرعی نظام کے اطلاق کا اعلان کرنا چاہتے ہیں۔ مولانا کو یہ خطبہ دینے سے روکنے کے لئے رکاوٹیں کھڑی کی جاتی ہیں۔ اس دوران نماز جمعہ کے اوقات گزرجانے تک اسلام آباد کے تمام رہائشی مولانا کے اجتماعی سہولت کار تصور کر لئے جاتے ہیں اور اپنے موبائل فونوں کی بندش سے اپنی ناکردہ خطائوں کا کفارہ ادا کرتے ہیں۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>مسلمان اور مرتد کے مابین فرق کے قضیے سے بچنے کی فکر کے باوجود میں اس امر پر اپنی پریشانی کا اظہار کرنے سے باز نہیں رہ سکتا کہ اسلامی نظریاتی کونسل کے جس اجلاس میں اشرفی اور شیرانی کے درمیان جھگڑا ہوا وہاں مبینہ طور پر اس سوال پر بھی غور ہونا تھا کہ آیا پاکستان میں مقیم غیر مسلموں کو ذمی قرار دے کر ان پر کسی طرح کا جزیہ لاگو کیا جانا چاہیے یا نہیں۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>ان دنوں مسلمانوں پر ساری دُنیا میں چھپائی اذیتوں سے قطعی بے اعتناکوئی انتہائی سفاک شخص ہی ایسے سوالات کو اس ادارے کے روبروپیش کرنے کی حماقت کا ارتکاب کر سکتا ہے۔ ہمارے ہاں تحریری طور پر موجود آئین کو \"کاغذ کے چند ٹکڑوں\" کے سوا کچھ نہیں سمجھا جاتا۔ گلوبل صحافت سے جڑے افراد مگر اس ضمن میں کافی مختلف ہوا کرتے ہیں۔ اسلامی نظریاتی کونسل کیا ہے، یہ جاننے کے لئے لندن، نیویارک یا پیرس وغیرہ کے کسی اخبار کے لئے کام کرتا صحافی سب سے پہلے ہمارے آئین کی کتاب کھولے گا۔ یہ کتاب اسے بتائے گی کہ اسلامی نظریاتی کونسل ایک حوالے سے اتنا ہی طاقت ور ادارہ ہے جیسا اسلامی جمہوریہ ایران میں جید علماء کی اس تنظیم کی صورت میں موجود ہے جو وہاں کی اسمبلی کے بنائے قوانین کو اسلامی اصولوں کی روشنی میں رد کر سکتا ہے۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>اس ادارے کو گویا ایک قسم کی ویٹو پاور میسر ہونے کی بناء پر اسلامی جمہوریہ ایران کا \"سپریم\" ادارہ بھی کہا جاسکتا ہے۔ میرے جیسے لوگ کچھ بھی کر لیں لندن، نیویارک یا پیرس وغیرہ کے کسی اخبار کے لئے کام کرتے صحافی کو ایران اور پاکستان میں کام کرنے والے جید علماء پر مبنی ان اداروں میں فرق سمجھا نہیں پائیں گے۔ میڈیا ویسے بھی پیچیدہ ترین موضوعات کو سادہ ترین لفظوں میں بیان کرنے پر مجبور ہوتا ہے۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>مولانا شیرانی اور حافظ اشرفی کے درمیان جھگڑے کی وجہ سے باقی دُنیا کو پیغام گیا ہے تو صرف اتنا کہ پاکستان میں غیر مسلموں کو ذمی قرار دے کر ان پر کسی نوعیت کا ٹیکس عائد کرنے کے بارے میں \"سنجیدگی\" سے سوچا جا رہا ہے اور یہ قضیہ اتنا سنگین ہو گیا ہے کہ اس پر بحث کے دوران دو جید علماء ایک دوسرے کے ساتھ ہاتھا پائی پر مجبور ہو گئے۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>اپنے ملک کے بارے میں اس تصور کے فروغ کے بعد میں کس منہ سے ڈونلڈٹرمپ کی مذمت میں کوئی لفظ لکھ پائوں گا۔ بھارت میں ہندو انتہاء پسندوہاں کے مسلمانوں پر غضب ڈھاتے ہوئے بات تو یہی کہتے ہیں ناں کہ دو قومی نظریے کی بنیاد پر برصغیرکے مسلمانوں نے \"بھارت ماتا\" کو توڑ کر پاکستان بنا لیا۔ اب ہندوستان میں مسلمان کیوں رہ رہے ہیں اور اپنے لئے برابری والے شہری حقوق کا تقاضہ کیوں کرتے ہیں۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>صرف برطانیہ میں مقیم پاکستانی مسلمانوں کی تعداد کوذرا ذہن میں لائیے۔ ان میں سے ذرا اس تناسب پر بھی غور کر لیں جو بے روزگار ہے مگر اپنے بچوں کی ضروریات کے عین مطابق گھر اور ان کی مناسب تعلیم کا حق دار ہے۔ ہماری اسلامی نظریاتی کونسل میں موجود چند فاترالعقل لوگوں جیسے افراد کو برطانیہ میں سیاسی قوت واختیار مل گیا تو بے روزگاری الائونس وغیرہ سے محروم پاکستانی مسلمانوں کی کفالت کا بندوبست ہم کیسے کریں گے۔ ہم تو ان بے خانماں افراد کا بھی سہارا نہ بن پائے جو لاکھوں کی تعداد میں تھے اور بنگلہ دیش بن جانے کے بعد بھی میرپور وغیرہ کے کیمپوں میں محصور ہوئے خود کو \"پاکستانی\" کہلوانے پر بضد رہے۔ بشکریہ روزنامہ\"نوائے وقت\"</p>\n\t\t</section>\n\t</body>\n"

Image analysis was performed by 2 radiologists independently, and the intraclass correlation coefficient was computed. Histologic diagnosis was obtained in every patient. For comparison of apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs), a paired 2-tailed Student t test with a Bonferroni correction was used.', 'In 136 patients, a primary parotid gland tumor was confirmed by histology. Among the observers, a high correlation was calculated (0.98). ADC values of pleomorphic adenomas were significantly higher than those of all other entities, except for myoepithelial adenomas (P = .054). ADC values of Warthin tumors were different from those of myoepithelial adenomas, lipomas, and salivary duct carcinomas (P<.001, 0.013, and .037, respectively).

The control group of patients received a PLT transfusion on randomly selected dates without experiencing an FTR. The \"event\" was defined as the PLT transfusion that caused the FTR in the FTR group or the index PLT transfusion in the control group. The number of transfused blood products and their proximity to the event were recorded along with other recipient data. The primary endpoint was the rate of RBC alloimmunization between the two groups.', 'There were 190 recipients in the FTR group and 245 in the control group. Overall, the recipients in the control group were younger and received more blood products on the day of their event and over the subsequent 10 days.

It is difficult to distinguish FFT from carotid plaque, but the distinction is critical as management differs. By contouring the shape of these vascular lesions (\"virtual endarterectomy\"), advanced morphometric analysis can be performed. The objective of our study is to determine whether quantitative shape analysis can accurately differentiate FFT from atherosclerotic plaque.', 'We collected 23 consecutive cases of suspected carotid FFT seen on CTA (13 men, 65 ± 10 years; 10 women, 65.5 ± 8.8 years). True-positive FFT cases (FFT+) were defined as filling defects resolving with anticoagulant therapy versus false-positives (FFT-), which remained unchanged. Lesion volumes were extracted from CTA images and quantitative shape descriptors were computed. The five most discriminative features were used to construct receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves and to generate three machine-learning classifiers. Average classification accuracy was determined by cross-validation.', 'Follow-up imaging confirmed sixteen FFT+ and seven FFT- cases. Five shape descriptors delineated FFT+ from FFT- cases. The logistic regression model produced from combining all five shape features demonstrated a sensitivity of 87.5% and a specificity of 71.4% with an area under the ROC curve = 0.85 ± 0.09. Average accuracy for each classifier ranged from 65.2%-76.4%.']",

        "context.contexts": "['Evidence-based practice (EBP) is widely promoted, but does EBP produce better patient outcomes? We report a natural experiment when part of the internal medicine service in a hospital was reorganized in 2003 to form an EBP unit, the rest of the service remaining unchanged. The units attended similar patients until 2012 permitting comparisons of outcomes and activity.', 'We used routinely collected statistics (2004-11) to compare the two different methods of practice and test whether patients being seen by the EBP unit differed from standard practice (SP) patients. Data were available by doctor and year. To check for differences between the EBP and SP doctors prior to reorganization, we used statistics from 2000 to 2003. We looked for changes in patient outcomes or activity following reorganization and whether the EBP unit was achieving significantly different results from SP. Data across the periods were combined and tested using Mann-Whitney test.', \"No statistically significant differences in outcomes were detected between the EBP and the SP doctors prior to reorganization. Following the unit's establishment, the mortality of patients being treated by EBP doctors compared with their previous performance dropped from 7.4% to 6.3% (P\\u2009<\\u20090.02) and length of stay from 9.15 to 6.01 days (P\\u2009=\\u20090.002). No statistically significant improvements were seen in SP physicians' performance. No differences in the proportion of patients admitted or their complexity between the services were detected. Despite this, EBP patients had a clinically significantly lower risk of death 6.27% versus 7.75% (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001) and a shorter length of stay 6.01 versus 8.46 days (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001) than SP patients. Readmission rates were similar: 14.4% (EBP); 14.5% (SP). EBP doctors attended twice as many patients/doctor as SP doctors.\"]",

A 'before-and-after' study design was used to assess any changes in practice, and to monitor whether any changes occurred in the district during the time of the study; data were also collected at the third MOU. Data were collected by scoring of the obstetric files after the patient had delivered.\", 'We ascertained whether the obstetric history, syphilis testing, blood group testing, haemoglobin measurement and uterine growth assessment were performed during antenatal care along with whether appropriate action was taken. For intrapartum care, estimation of fetal weight, the performance of pelvimetry, blood pressure monitoring, urine testing, evaluation of head above pelvis, fetal heart rate monitoring, monitoring of contractions and plotting of cervical dilatation, and whether the appropriate actions were taken, were assessed.', 'Eight of the 13 midwives at the two MOUs completed the PEP and all demonstrated an improvement in knowledge. Case notes of 303 patients from the various clinics were studied. There was no change in the referral patterns of any of the clinics during the study period. The obstetric history was well documented, but in no group was there a satisfactory response to a detected problem; appropriate action was taken in between 0% and 12% of cases. Syphilis testing was performed in 56-82% of cases, with no difference between the groups. The haemoglobin level was measured in only 4-15% of patients, with no difference before or after completion of the PEP. Where a problem in uterine growth was detected, an appropriate response occurred in 0-8% of patients and no difference before or after completion of the PEP was ascertained. In all groups, estimation of fetal weight and pelvimetry were seldom performed, the urine and fetal heart rate documentation were moderately well done and the blood pressure monitoring, assessment of head above pelvis, monitoring of contractions and plotting of cervical dilatation were usually performed. No differences before or after the PEP were detected. Where problems were detected, appropriate actions taken during labour improved, but not significantly.']",

Of 42 possible points, 7 points are directly related to measurement of language compared with only 2 points related to neglect.', 'We examined the placebo arm of the NINDS t-PA stroke trial to test the hypothesis that the total volume of cerebral infarction in patients with right hemisphere strokes would be greater than the volume of cerebral infarction in patients with left hemisphere strokes who have similar NIHSS scores. The volume of stroke was determined by computerized image analysis of CT films and CT images stored on computer tape and optical disks. Cube-root transformation of lesion volume was performed for each CT. Transformed lesion volume was analyzed in a logistic regression model to predict volume of stroke by NIHSS score for each hemisphere. Spearman rank correlation was used to determine the relation between the NIHSS score and lesion volume.', 'The volume for right hemisphere stroke was statistically greater than the volume for left hemisphere strokes, adjusting for the baseline NIHSS (P<0. 001). For each 5-point category of the NIHSS score<20, the median volume of right hemisphere strokes was approximately double the median volume of left hemisphere strokes. For example, for patients with a left hemisphere stroke and a 24-hour NIHSS score of 16 to 20, the median volume of cerebral infarction was 48 mL (interquartile range 14 to 111 mL) as compared with 133 mL (interquartile range 81 to 208 mL) for patients with a right hemisphere stroke (P<0.001). The median volume of a right hemisphere stroke was roughly equal to the median volume of a left hemisphere stroke in the next highest 5-point category of the NIHSS. The Spearman rank correlation between the 24-hour NIHSS score and 3-month lesion volume was 0.72 for patients with left hemisphere stroke and 0.71 for patients with right hemisphere stroke.']",

The authors developed a scale to assess the perceived career threats of having children during residency, evaluated its psychometric properties, and calculated the effect of the mediators.', 'The response rate was 77% (328/424). Forty-one percent of men versus 27% of women planned to have children during residency (P = .01).

The scale had a Cronbach alpha of 0.84 and an eigenvalue of 2.2. Compared with men, women had higher scores for each item and a higher mean score (2.9 versus 2.1, P = .001), signifying greater belief in the potential of pregnancy to threaten careers. After adjusting for age, institution, postgraduate year, and knowledge of parental leave policies, women were less likely to plan to have children during residency (odds ratio 0.46 [95% confidence interval 0.25-0.84]).

Groups 4 (primiparous) and 5 (multiparous) were healthy pregnant subjects previously enrolled in another study to determine the incidence and cause of pregnancy complications, such as preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction. The Primiparous group included 114 women in their first pregnancy, whereas the Multiparous group consisted of 79 women with 2 or more pregnancies but without pregnancy loss.', 'The rate of extreme skewing (90% or greater) in the recurrent spontaneous abortion population was 8.6%, and not statistically different from any of the other groups, except the Primiparous group (1.0%, P<.01). The incidence of X-inactivation skewing of 90% or greater was no different whether there had been at least 1 live birth (9.9%), or no previous live births and at least 3 losses (5.6%, P>.05). When age and skewing of 90% or greater are compared, subjects with extreme skewing have a mean age of 2 years older than those without extreme skewing (P<.05).']",

Patients requiring surgical extraction of a single impacted third molar and who fell within the inclusion criteria and indicated willingness to return for recall visits were recruited. The predictor variable was application of PRP gel to the socket of the third molar in the test group, whereas the control group had no PRP. The outcome variables were pain, swelling, and maximum mouth opening, which were measured using a 10-point visual analog scale, tape, and millimeter caliper, respectively. Socket healing was assessed radiographically by allocating scores for lamina dura, overall density, and trabecular pattern. Quantitative data were presented as mean. Mann-Whitney test was used to compare means between groups for continuous variables, whereas Fischer exact test was used for categorical variables. Statistical significance was inferred at P<.05.', 'Sixty patients aged 19 to 35 years (mean: 24.7 ± 3.6 years) were divided into both test and control groups of 30 patients each. The mean postoperative pain score (visual analog scale) was lower for the PRP group at all time points and this was statistically significant (P<.05). Although the figures for swelling and interincisal mouth opening were lower in the test group, this difference was not statistically significant. Similarly, the scores for lamina dura, trabecular pattern, and bone density were better among patients in the PRP group. This difference was also not statistically significant.']",

        "context.contexts": "['Two common causes of cervical myelopathy include degenerative stenosis and ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL). It has been postulated that patients with OPLL have more complications and worse outcomes than those with degenerative stenosis. The authors sought to compare the surgical results of laminoplasty in the treatment of cervical stenosis with myelopathy due to either degenerative changes or segmental OPLL.', 'The authors conducted a retrospective review of 40 instrumented laminoplasty cases performed at a single institution over a 4-year period to treat cervical myelopathy without kyphosis. Twelve of these patients had degenerative cervical stenotic myelopathy ([CSM]; degenerative group), and the remaining 28 had segmental OPLL (OPLL group). The 2 groups had statistically similar demographic characteristics and number of treated levels (mean 3.9 surgically treated levels; p>0.05). The authors collected perioperative and follow-up data, including radiographic results.', 'The overall clinical follow-up rate was 88%, and the mean clinical follow-up duration was 16.4 months. The mean radiographic follow-up rate was 83%, and the mean length of radiographic follow-up was 9.3 months. There were no significant differences in the estimated blood loss (EBL) or length of hospital stay (LOS) between the groups (p>0.05). The mean EBL and LOS for the degenerative group were 206 ml and 3.7 days, respectively. The mean EBL and LOS for the OPLL group were 155 ml and 4 days, respectively. There was a statistically significant improvement of more than one grade in the Nurick score for both groups following surgery (p<0.05). The Nurick score improvement was not statistically different between the groups (p>0.05). The visual analog scale (VAS) neck pain scores were similar between groups pre- and postoperatively (p>0.05). The complication rates were not statistically different between groups either (p>0.05). Radiographically, both groups lost extension range of motion (ROM) following laminoplasty, but this change was not statistically significant (p>0.05).']",

All patients with myelomeningocele (MM) are radiographically tethered, and untethering procedures carry significant morbidity risks including worsening neurological function and wound complications. No guidelines exist as regards untethering in patients with MM prior to scoliosis correction surgery. The authors' aim in this study was to evaluate their experience in patients with MM who were not untethered before scoliosis correction.\", 'Seventeen patients with MM were retrospectively identified and 1) had no evidence of a clinically symptomatic tethered cord, 2) had undergone spinal fusion for scoliosis correction, and 3) had not been untethered for at least 1 year prior to surgery. The minimum follow-up after fusion was 2 years. Charts and radiographs were reviewed for neurological or shunt complications in the perioperative period.', 'The average age of the patients was 12.4 years, and the following neurological levels were affected: T-12 and above, 7 patients; L-1/L-2, 6 patients; L-3, 2 patients; and L-4, 2 patients. All were radiographically tethered as confirmed on MR imaging. Fourteen of the patients (82%) had a ventriculoperitoneal shunt. The mean Cobb angle was corrected from 82 degrees to 35 degrees , for a 57% correction. All patients underwent neuromonitoring of their upper extremities, and some underwent lower extremity monitoring as well. Postoperatively, no patient experienced a new cranial nerve palsy, shunt malfunction, change in urological function, or upper extremity weakness/sensory loss. One patient had transient lower extremity weakness, which returned to baseline within 1 month of surgery.']",

پر قبضے کی بھی بات کی گئی تھی، یعنی اس سب کے نتیجے میں بہت ہی زیادہ بگاڑ تھا۔ اس وقت کچھ بھی ہو سکتا تھا۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>مشاہد اللہ کے بقول اس وقت جو سازش تیار کی جا رہی تھی اس کا نشانہ صرف سول حکومت یا وزیراعظم نواز شریف نہیں تھے بلکہ یہ سازش بری فوج کے سربراہ کے خلاف بھی تھی۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>'اس سازش کا ایک حصہ یہ بھی تھا کہ وزیراعظم نواز شریف اور جنرل راحیل شریف کے درمیان اتنی خلیج اور اختلافات پیدا کر دیے جائیں کہ نواز شریف کو مجبور کر دیا جائے کہ وہ جنرل راحیل کے خلاف کوئی ایکشن لیں اور جب وہ ایکشن لیں تو اس وقت کچھ لوگ اس وقت حرکت میں آئیں اور اقتدار پر قابض ہو جائیں</p>\n\t\t\t<p>اس سوال پر کہ جب اسلام آباد میں اتنی سنگین سازش تیار ہو رہی تھی اور اس پر عمل کرنے کی کوشش ہو رہی تھی عین اس وقت وزیراعظم نواز شریف اچانک وزیراعظم ہاؤس چھوڑ کر اپنے اہل خانہ سمیت لاہور کیوں چلے گئے؟</p>\n\t\t\t<p>مشاہد اللہ نے کہا کہ وزیراعظم کو ایوان وزیراعظم سے باہر نکالنے کا فیصلہ بھی ایک سازش سے بچنے کے لیے کیا گیا تھا۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>اس کی تفصیل بتاتےہوئے مشاہد اللہ نے کہا کہ 31 اگست کے روز انٹیلی جنس بیورو اور بعض دیگر ذرائع سے حکومت کو خبر ملی کہ اسلحے سے بھری دو گاڑیاں وزیراعظم ہاؤس کی طرف آ رہی ہیں۔ اس وقت تک پی ٹی وی پر قبضہ ہو چکا تھا اور لوگ سیکریٹریٹ اور وزیراعظم ہاؤس کی طرف بڑھ رہے تھے۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>'ایسے میں حکومت کے پاس اس کے علاوہ کوئی راستہ نہیں تھا کہ وزیراعظم کو وہاں سے نکال کر محفوظ مقام پر منتقل کر دیا جائے۔ بعد میں ہمیں معلوم ہوا کہ فوج ہی کے ایک افسر نے دو گاڑیوں کو پکڑا جو وزیراعظم ہاؤس جانے کی کوشش کر رہی تھیں۔ ان گاڑیوں میں پچیس پچیس کلاشنکوف تھیں</p>\n\t\t\t<p>اس سوال پر کہ یہ بندوقیں کس نے اور کہاں استعمال کرنی تھیں، مشاہد اللہ خان نے کہا: 'جب میں نے اس بارے میں دریافت کیا تو مجھے بتایا گیا کہ ان کے کچھ لوگ وہاں (وزیراعظم ہاؤس) پہلے ہی پہنچ چکے تھے جنہوں نے ان کلاشنکوفوں کو استعمال کرنا تھا۔ بس یہ اسلحہ اندر لانے کی دیر تھی۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>جب ان سے پوچھا گیا کہ ایک طرف آپ بعض فوجی جرنیلوں پر حکومت کے خلاف سازش کا الزام لگا رہے ہیں اور دوسری طرف وزیراعظم ہاؤس اور دیگر اہم عمارات کی حفاظت کی ذمہ داری بھی فوج ہی کو دے دی گئی، مشاہد اللہ نے کہا کہ فوج بطور ادارہ حکومت کے خلاف اس سازش میں شامل نہیں تھی۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>'بعض بہت موثر اور سینیئر جرنیل اس سازش میں ملوث تھے، جن میں لیفٹینٹ جنرل ظہیرالاسلام بھی شامل ہیں لیکن جنرل راحیل اور پاکستانی فوج ایک ادارے کے طور پر اس سازش میں شامل نہیں تھی۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>مشاہد اللہ نے کہا کہ اگر جنرل راحیل حکومت ختم کرنے کی خواہش رکھتے تو پھر دھرنوں وغیرہ کی ضرورت ہی نہیں پیش آنی تھی۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>اس سوال پر کہ حکومت کو اس دھرنے کی آڑ میں ہونے والی اس مبینہ سازش کا علم کب ہوا، تو مشاہداللہ خان نے کہا کہ حکومت کو پہلے دن سے اس سازش کا علم تھا۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>'ہمیں پتہ تھا کہ لندن میں طاہر القادری اور عمران خان کے درمیان ہونے والی ملاقات میں آئی ایس آئی کے کچھ لوگ بھی موجود تھے۔ ہم یہ بھی جانتے تھے کہ اس ملاقات میں کیا کچھ طے ہوا کہ کس نے لاہور سے کب چلنا ہے، کہاں پہنچنا ہے، کیا کرنا ہے۔'</p>\n\t\t\t<p>انھوں نے کہا کہ حکومت نے پہلے دن ہی سے یہ تہیہ کر رکھا تھا کہ کسی بھی قیمت پر ان لوگوں کے خلاف طاقت استعمال نہیں کرنی کیونکہ بعض طاقتیں یہی چاہتی تھیں کہ حکومت طاقت استعمال کرے اور ان کی سازش پر عمل کا راستہ ہموار ہو جائے۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>اس مبینہ سازش میں ملوث ہونے پر آئی ایس آئی کے سابق سربراہ جنرل ریٹائرڈ ظہیر اسلام عباسی کے خلاف کارروائی کے امکانات کے بارے میں ایک سوال پر مشاہد اللہ نے کہا کہ پاکستان میں جمہوریت ابھی اتنی طاقتور نہیں کہ اس طرح کی کارروائی کر سکے۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>گو کہ ہماری حکومت نے جنرل مشرف کے خلاف مقدمہ تو درج کیا لیکن ہم ان کے خلاف بھی اس طرح کی کارروائی نہیں کر سکے جیسا کہ کی جانی چاہیے تھی۔ وزیراعظم کی ساری توجہ ملکی استحکام اور اسے آگے لے جانے پر مرکوز ہے۔ ایسے موقع پر وہ اس قسم کی انکوائری یا کارروائی کا فیصلہ نہیں کرنا چاہتے۔</p>\n\t\t</section>\n\t</body>\n"

        "document_body": "<body>\n\t\t<section>\n\t\t\t<p>پس ثابت ہوا کہ مقصود و مطلوب کرپشن کا خاتمہ نہیں، نواز شریف کے اقتدار کا خاتمہ ہے۔ صرف وہ کمیشن قبول ہے جو ایک ایسا پھندا ایجاد کر سکے جو صرف اور صرف نواز شریف کے گلے ہی کے لیے بنا ہو۔کرپشن کی دیگر صورتوں سے کسی کو کوئی دلچسپی ہے اور نہ کسی دوسرے 'کرپٹ' سے۔ میرے نزدیک یہ مقدمہ اتنا واضح ہے کہ اس کے خلاف کوئی دلیل تلاش کر نے کے لیے بڑی جرأت چاہیے۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>لوگ کہتے ہیں نواز شریف صاحب نے دیر کی اور یہ کہ اپنے حق میں اچھا نہیں کیا۔ اگر وہ پہلے ہی چیف جسٹس کی قیادت میں کوئی کمیشن بنا دیتے تو اتنا غبارنہ اٹھتا۔ میرا خیال ہے یہ اچھا ہوا۔ اگر وہ پہلے ہی ایسا کرتے تو یہ مقدمہ اتنی صراحت کے ساتھ نمایاں نہ ہو تا کہ ہمیں صرف نواز شریف کا سر چاہیے، ان کے سوا کرپشن میں مبتلا مبینہ مجرموں سے ہمیں کوئی سرو کار نہیں۔ نواز شریف صاحب تو مبینہ نہیں، یقیناً مجرم ہیں اور دلیل یہ ہے کہ 'ہم کہہ رہے ہیں' اب کون ہے جو اس برہانِ قاطع کے بعد، دلیل مانگنے کی جسارت کرے؟</p>\n\t\t\t<p>پہلے مطالبہ ہوا کہ چیف جسٹس کی قیادت میں کمیشن بنے۔ جب بن گیا تو کہا گیا کہ وہ قانون ہی ناقص ہے جس کے تحت بنا ہے۔ پہلے نیا قانون بنائو۔ سوال یہ ہے کہ جب یہ مطالبہ کیا جا رہا تھا،اس وقت حامد خان صاحب جیسے قانونی دماغ نہیں جانتے تھے کہ جو کمیشن بنے گا کسی مو جود قانون ہی کے تحت بنے گا۔ پھر تحریکِ انصاف کے وکلا نے اس قانون پر جو اعتراضات اٹھائے ہیں،ان کا جواب بھی دے دیا گیا۔ یہ کمیشن ایف بی آر سمیت ہر ادارے سے معاونت لے سکے گا۔ کمیشن کی شرائط <annotation lang=\"en\">(TORs)</annotation></p>\n\t\t\t<p>طے کرنے میں کلیدی کردار بیرسٹر ظفراللہ خان کا ہے۔ وہ بتا چکے کہ کمیشن فورنزک آڈٹ کا حکم دے سکتا ہے، اس پر رازداری کے کسی قانون کا اطلاق نہیں ہو گا۔ بیرونِ ملک سے شواہد چاہئیں توکیبنٹ ڈویژن تمام وسائل مہیا کرے گا۔ یہ سب وہ باتیں ہیں جو خورشید شاہ یا اسد عمر کہہ رہے ہیں۔ یہ سب مطالبات شرائط میں شامل ہیں۔ اب کہا جا ر ہا ہے کہ نواز شریف اپنے خلاف تحقیقات کے لیے کیسے کمیشن بنا سکتے ہیں۔ معترضین یہ نہیں جانتے کہ یہ کمیشن نواز شریف نامی کسی آ دمی نے نہیں، وزیر اعظم پاکستان نے بنا یا ہے اور آئین انہی کو یہ حق دیتا ہے۔ پھر یہ کہ ملزموں میں بھی نواز شریف نام کا کوئی آ دمی شامل نہیں۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>کہا گیا کہ کمیشن صرف پاناما لیکس کے لیے خاص ہو؟ کیوں؟ اس کا کوئی جواب نہیں۔ اگر کرپشن کا خاتمہ مطلوب ہے تو یہ اسی وقت ممکن ہوگا جب اس کی ہر صورت اور اس کا ہر مجرم کیفرِ کردار تک پہنچے۔ اگر اس میں کچھ وقت زیادہ لگ جائے تو اس میں کیا حرج ہے؟ اس سوال کا جواب اسی وقت اثبات میں دیا جا سکتا ہے جب لوگوں کا ہدف کرپشن ہو،کوئی فرد واحد نہیں۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>اس وقت نواز شریف کے خلاف نفرت اپنی آ خری حدوں کو چھو رہی ہے۔ ان کے تمام سیاسی مخالفین یہ جان چکے کہ ان کے لیے وہ سیاسی اعتبار سے ناقابلِ تسخیر ہو چکے۔ ان کو انتخابی یا آئینی طریقے سے ہٹانا کم از کم اس وقت مخالفین کے لیے ممکن نہیں۔ وہ خود کو کسی طرح سے بہتر متبادل ثابت نہیں کر سکے۔ نواز شریف قائد اعظم نہیں ہیں۔ اخلاقی حوالے سے کوئی مثالی لیڈر نہیں ہیں۔ المیہ یہ ہے کہ ان کے مخالفین ان کے مقابلے میں بھی کھڑا ہونے کی اہلیت نہیں رکھتے۔ ان کی عمر ڈھلتی جا رہی ہے اور نواز شریف کے اقتدار کا سورج ڈھلنے کا نام نہیں لے رہا۔ وہ اس سے زچ آ چکے۔ ان کے پاس وقت کم ہے۔ وہ اب اس کے لیے سب کچھ کر گزرنے کے لیے تیار ہیں۔ اب وہ یہاں تک آ پہنچے ہیںکہ بہو کا مان توڑنے کے لیے بیٹا مر تا ہے تو مر جائے۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>نواز شریف کو گرانے کے لیے ملک و قوم کسی عذاب سے گزرتے ہیں تو وہ اس کے لیے بھی تیار ہیں۔ سوال یہ ہے کہ نواز شریف کے خلاف یہ نفرت آخر اتنی گہری کیوں ہے؟</p>\n\t\t\t<p>پہلے پیپلز پارٹی کو دیکھیے۔ پیپلز پارٹی، ایک وقت تھا کہ اس ملک کی سب سے بڑی جماعت تھی۔کوئی ایک جماعت یہ صلاحیت نہیں رکھتی تھی کہ اس کو تنہا شکست دے سکے۔ اس کے لیے ہمیشہ اتحاد بنائے جاتے تھے اور وہ بھی ناکام رہتے۔ اس میں شبہ نہیں کہ ملک میں ایک بڑا ووٹ بینک پیپلز پارٹی کے خلاف مو جود تھا۔ جنرل ضیاء الحق نے اس راز کو پا لیا کہ اگر کوئی ایک ایسا لیڈر پنجاب سے نمودار ہو جائے جو پیپلز پارٹی مخالف ووٹوں کو جمع کر سکے تو اس پارٹی سے نجات ممکن ہے۔ ان کی نظرِ انتخاب نواز شریف پر پڑی۔ جنرل حمید گل تک ملٹری اسٹیبلشمنٹ نے انہیں تیار کیا۔ پہلے اتحادوں کا لیڈر بنوایا اور پھر ان کے ساتھ اُن افرادکو جمع کر دیا جو اپنا حلقہ انتخاب جیتنے کی صلاحیت رکھتے تھے۔ نواز شریف اپنی محنت اور سرمایے کی مدد سے وہ لیڈر بن گئے جو تنہا پیپلز پارٹی کو شکست دے سکتا تھا۔ پیپلز پارٹی اس بات کو کبھی نہیں بھول سکتی۔ یہ ان کے لیے بھٹو صاحب کی پھانسی سے برا حادثہ تھا۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>جماعت اسلامی کی نفرت بھی قابلِ فہم ہے۔ نواز شریف نے جماعت کو اس تھوڑے بہت ووٹ بینک سے بھی محروم کر دیا جو وہ اسلام پسندوں کی نمائندگی کے باعث رکھتی تھی۔ 1993ء میں نواز شریف نے جماعت سے نہ صرف ووٹ بینک بلکہ وہ نظریاتی وکیل بھی چھین لیے جنہوںنے فکری و صحافتی میدان میں جماعت کا مقدمہ لڑا۔ 1993ء کے انتخابات وہ موقع ہے جو جماعت صلاح الدین شہید، جناب الطاف حسن قریشی اور جناب مجیب الرحمٰن شامی جیسے وکلاسے محروم ہوئی۔کوئی اس کو سمجھنا چاہے تو وہ مناظرہ پڑھ لے جو محترم قاضی حسین احمد صاحب اور شامی صاحب کے مابین ہوا۔ اس کے بعد پھر جماعت کا ووٹ بینک اسے واپس مل سکا اور نہ قریشی وشامی جیسے وکیل۔ جماعت کے نصیب کی بارش اب کسی اور چھت پر برس رہی تھی۔ اس کے ذمہ دار نواز شریف تھے۔ اب جماعت والے ولی اللہ تو ہیں نہیں کہ اس سب کچھ کو ٹھنڈے پیٹوں برداشت کر لیں۔ انہیں بھی اپنا انتقام لینا ہے۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>عمران خان کا مسئلہ بھی واضح ہے۔ ان کا خیال ہے کہ عوام ان پر فریفتہ ہیں۔ وہ خود تو کسی سے محبت کرنے کے پابند نہیں لیکن عوام یک طرفہ رومان پہ آ مادہ ہیں۔ اکثریت ان کے ساتھ ہے لیکن نواز شریف کو ایسے سیاسی گر آتے ہیں کہ وہ ان کی فتح کو شکست میں بدل دیتے ہیں۔ آئندہ بھی، اگر وہ سیاست میں ایک کھلاڑی کے طور پر مو جود ہیں تو اقتدار کی دیوی ان پر مہربان نہیں ہو سکتی۔ یہ سوچ ان کی نفسیات میں اتنی گہرائی تک اتر چکی ہے کہ وہ انہیں ہر حال میں راستے سے ہٹانا چاہتے ہیں۔ دھرنے کے بعد تو کم ہی لوگ ہیں جنہیں اس پر شک ہے۔ اس کے لیے وہ طاہر القادری جیسے لوگوں کو ساتھ ملا سکتے ہیں۔ شیر پائو سے اتحاد کر سکتے ہیں، حتیٰ کہ اب زرداری صاحب کو بھی گلے لگا سکتے ہیں۔ نواز شریف کے خلاف نفرت پیدا کرنا ان کی سیاسی حکمت کا بنیادی پتھر ہے۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>یہ ہے اس ملک کا سیاسی اثاثہ۔ اس اثاثے کے ساتھ کیا کسی منزل کا حصول ممکن ہے؟اس لیے میں عرض کر تا ہوں کہ سسٹم میں اصلاح کی ایسی کوشش ہونی چاہیے جو ہمیں کسی نئی آز مائش سے دوچار نہ کرے۔ 126 دن ہم نے ضائع کیے۔ نواز شریف صاحب کے اس سوال میں وزن ہے کہ اس کا حساب کون دے گا؟ کیا یہ عمل خود احتساب کا متقاضی نہیں؟ اس لیے اب یہ سوال اٹھایا جانا چاہیے کہ اپوزیشن کا مطالبہ تسلیم کر نے کے بعد کسی نئی مہم جوئی کا کیا عقلی اوراخلاقی جواز ہے؟یہ بہت ا فسوس ناک ہو گا اگر اس تجزیے کو نواز شریف کی حمایت قرار دیا جائے۔ رومان اور ہیجان یہی کرتے ہیں۔ ہمیں ان سے نکلنا ہوگا۔</p>\n\t\t</section>\n\t</body>\n"

کے مالکان کا نام بیرون ملک آف شور کمپنیاں چلانے اور اثاثے بنانے کی فہرست میں نظر آتا ہے.آف شور کمپنیاں دو قسم کی ہوتی ہیں. ایک آف شور کمپنی وہ کمپنی کہلاتی ہے جو پیداواری یا کسی بھی قسم کی خدمات فراہم کرنے والی کمپنیاں دوسرے ممالک میں قائم کرتی ہیں.اس قسم کی کمپنی کاـمقصد کمپنی کے اخراجات کو کم کر کے منافع زیادہ کرنا ہوتا ہے.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>مثال کے طور پر مختلف کمپنیاں اپنے کسٹمر سروس ڈیپارٹمنٹ مارکیٹنگ یا سوفٹ ویئر ڈیویلوپمنٹ کے شعبے ایسے ممالک میں بنا لیتے ہیں جہاں کم اجرت پر کام کرنے والے پڑھے لکھے لوگ میسر ہوں.پاکستان میں قائم کئی کال سینڑز سوفٹ ویئر ہاوسز میڈیکل ٹرانسکرپشن کی کمپنیاں اس کی مثال ہیں.دوسری قسم کی آف شور کمپنیاں وہ ہوتی ہیں جو ایسے ممالک میں قائم کی جاتی ہیں جہاں ان کمپنیوں کو ٹیکس میں چھوٹ حاصل ہوتی ہے ان کمپنیوں کو دولت یا سرمائے کے سفید یا کالا ہونے کے  دوارے سوالات نہیں پوچھے جاتے اور ان کمپنیوں کی تمام کاروباری سرگرمیوں کو خفیہ رکھا جاتا ہے. دوسرے الفاظ میں زیادہ تر کالے دھن کو سفید کرنے کیلئے ان کمپنیوں کو استعمال کیا جاتا ہے.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>سرمائے کی دنیا میں کالے دھن کو سفید بنا کر کاروباری انوسٹمنٹ کے زریعے بیرون ممالک میں رقم کمانے اور چھپانے کا یہ بہترین زریعہ ہے. پاکستانی وزیراعظم نواز شریف کے بچوں اور دیگر اہم شخصیات  کے  باہر اثاثہ جات اور کاروباری سرگرمیوں دوارے ہر شخص کو خبر تھی لیکن دستاویزی ثبوت اور مختلف شواہد کے ساتھ ان کمپنیوں کے نام اور پچھلی کئی دہائیوں پر مبنی فنانشل ٹرانسکشنز نے سب کا کچ چٹھہ  عیاں کر دیا.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>انٹرنیشنل کانسرشیم آف انویسٹیگیٹو جرنلزم نے کڑوڑہا صفحات پر مشتمل دستاویزات پر انتہائی محنت اور جانفشانی سے ریسرچ کے بعد عالمی دنیا کے کارپوریٹ اور سیاسیّ کلچر کے اس بھیانک چہرے کو عریاں کر کے یقینا ایک گرانقدر خدمت سرانجام دی ہے.پاکستانی صحافت کے معزز ترین ناموں میں سے ایک نام عمر چیمہ بھی اس ریسرچ اور پراجیکٹ کا حصہ تھے اور اس کیلئے جناب عمر چیمہ صاحب داد و تحسین کے مستحق ہیں. یہ سکینڈل عالمی اور ملکی سطح پر مختلف قسم کے اثرات مرتب کرتا دکھائی دیتا ہے.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>عالمی سرمائے کی منڈی میں کالے دھن اور دنیا کی بڑی بڑی سیاسی و کاروباری شخصیات کا ان آف شور کمپنیوں کی آڑ میں اس کالے دھن کو سفید کر کے منافع کمانا اس سرمایہ دارانہ نظام کی شفافیت پر نہ صرف کئی سوال کھڑے کرتا ہے بلکہ اس کے استحصالی ہونے کا واضح ثبوت بھی فراہم کرتا ہے.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>ملکی سیاست کی جانب دیکھئے تو پہلے سے کمزور وزیراعظم نواز شریف کیلئے یہ ایک بڑا سیاسی دھچکا ہے.گو ان آف شور کمپنیوں کا نواز شریف یا دیگر شخصیات کی اولادوں سے تعلق ہونا کسی بھی طور پر نواز شریف یا دیگر افراد کو کسی بھی قانون کے تحت مجرم نہیں بناتا لیکن بہرحال اخلاقی اور سیاسی محاذوں پر یہ پسپائی کا باعث بنتا ہے. خیر ہم جس معاشرے میں بستے ہیں وہاں دولت کمانے کے طریقوں پر بحث لاحاصل ہے.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>تیسری دنیا یا پسماندہ ممالک میں سیاست کاروبار اور سرکاری عہدوں پر قابض ہی اس لیئے ہوا جاتا ہے کہ دولت کمائی جا سکے. اس قسم کے جرائم کیلئے ایک اصطلاح استعمال کی جاتی ہے جسے \"وائٹ کرائم \" کا نام دیا جاتا ہے.کارپوریٹ اور سیاسی گٹھ جوڑ پر مبنی اس جرم کے ثبوت و شواہد عدالتوں میں ثابت کرنا یقینا ایک طرح سے ناممکن ہی تصور کیا جاتا ہے . لیکن پاکستان جیسے ملک میں سیاستدانوں اور بالخصوص وزیر اعظم کے خاندان کا اس سکینڈل میں نام آنا بطور مجموعی سیاست اور جمہوریت کیلئے زہر قاتل ہے.ہم اکثر وطن عزیز میں جمہوریت کے کمزور ہونے کی دہائیاں تو دیتے ہیں لیکن یہ نہیں دیکھتے کہ جمہوریت کے کمزور ہونے کی ایک بہت بڑی وجہ خود سیاستدان بھی ہیں.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>اگر نواز شریف اپنے آپ کو  ایک قومی رہنما تصور کرتے ہیں تو پھر کیا وجہ ہے کہ وہ آج تک اس سوال کا جواب نہیں دے پائے کہ جب سے وہ سیاست میں آئے ہیں ان کے اور ان کے اثاثہ جات میں مسلسل اضافہ ہی ہوتا چلا جا رہا ہے.پاکستان میں کسی بھی سیاستدان کو دیکھ لیجئے سیاست میں آتے ہی اس کے اثاثہ جات دن دوگنی اور رات چوگنی ترقی کرتے دکھائی دیتے ہیں. جب سیاستدان ہر قسم کی مالی یا اخلاقی بدعنوانی میں ملوث ہوں تو پھر جمہوریت کے مستحکم نہ ہو پانے پر کیسا شور؟ پس پشت قوتوں کو اگر آ بیل مجھے مار کے مصداق دعوت عام دی جائے اور پھر یہ تصور کیا جائے کہ بیل اب نہیں مارے گا تو اس سے بڑی حماقت اور کوئی بھی نہیں ہو سکتی.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>جمہوریت کا لبادہ اوڑھ کر بڑے بڑے صنعتکار  اور وڈیرے فوجی آمروں کی طرح شخصی حاکمیت پر قائم آمرانہ راج قائم کر کے خاندان اور احباب پر انعام و اکرام کی نوازشیں کرتے ہیں تو پھر عام آدمی کو اس سے ہرگز بھی فرق نہیں پڑتا کہ وطن میں جمہوری نظام ہے یا آمریت. ویسے بھی  غربت سے محروم آنکھیں اور لقمہ سے خالی پیٹ والے کڑوڑہا افراد کیلئے نظام وہ معنی رکھتا ہے جس میں ان کے گھروں کے چولہے جل سکیں.جمہوریت یا مہذب معاشرے کے حق میں دلائل بھی صرف بھرے ہوئے پیٹ دیتے ہیں.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>رائے ونڈ نوڈیرو یا بنی گالہ کے محلات سے زندگی کی تمام آسائشوں سے لطف اندوز ہوتے ہوئے جمہوریت پر لیکچر دینا بے حد آسان ہے اور حس جمالیات یا دانشوارانہ ذوق کی تسکین کیلئے باعث تسکین بھی. لیکن وطن عزیز کی نصف سے زائد آبادی جو خط غربت سے بھی نیچے زندگی بسر کرتی ہے اس کے لیئے یہ سب باتیں عملی طور پر کوئی معنی نہیں رکھتیں. اگر ایک جانب وزیر اعظم پاکستان کی اولادوں کے نام پر کڑوڑوں پاؤنڈز کی کاروباری سرگرمیاں بیرون ملک ہوں تو  وہ وزیر اعظم کس منہ سے ملک کے غریبوں سے غربت ختم کرنے کے دعوے کر سکتا ہے یا بیرونی سرمایہ داروں سے ملک میں  سرمایہ کاری کا بول سکتا ہے. کسی بھی رہنما کے سچے ہونے کی  دلیل اس کے عمل سے ہوتی ہے جیسے کہ نبی کریم کی زندگی تھی خلفائے راشدین کی زندگی تھی یا پھر ابراہم لنکن مارٹن لوتھر کنگ محمد علی جناح اور نیلسن منڈیلا کی زندگی تھی.یہ لوگ اپنی اپنی ندگی کے معاملات میں مکمل شفافیت اور ایمانداری سے کام لیتے تھے یہی وجہ ہے کہ ان سب نے نظام کو تبدیل کیا اور بڑے سے بڑا مخالف بھی ان کو زیر نہ کر پایا.موجودہ سیاسی قیادت جو وطن عزیز میں موجود پے ان سب کے دامن پر کرپشن اور سازشوں کے دھبے موجود ہیں. نواز شریف اور آصف زرداری یا الطاف حسین یا پھر عمران خان ان سب کی کمزوریوں اور مالی یا اخلاقی کرپشن نے اس وطن میں جمہوریت کی ساکھ کو شدید نقصان پہنچایا ہے.اپنے اپنے اقتدار کے شوق کی لالچ میں خود یہی افراد جمہوریت کے لیئے سب سے بڑا خطرہ بن چکے ہیں.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>ہمارے ساتھ تو المیہ یہ بھی ہے کہ ہمیں نہ تو آج تک خالص جمہوریت مل پائی اور نہ ہی خالص آمریت. جمہوریت کا راگ الاپتے قومی رہنما ہوں یا فوجی وردی میں ملبوس آمر سب  مال بٹور کر چلتے بنتے ہیں.عمران خان کا بنی گالہ کا محل ہو یا نواز شریف کا رائے ونڈ کا محل  یا پھر پرویز مشرف اور دیگر جرنیلوں کے شاندار فارم ہاوسز اور بنگلے یہ محلات چیخ چیخ کر وطن عزیز کے اس مسئلے کی طرف توجہ دلوانے کی کوشش کرتے ہیں جس میں اس وطن کے نظام میں ایک سفید پوش آدمی کو دینے کیلئے دھکوں اور ذلت کے سوا کچھ بھی نہیں.اور یہی وطن عزیز کا سب سے بڑا مسئلہ ہے .</p>\n\t\t\t<p>جمہوریت ہو یا آمریت یہ دونوں اشرافیہ کے گھر کی باندیاں ہیں. شاید وطن عزیز میں بسنے والے ہم سب لوگ ذہنی طور پر ابھی بھی غلامی کے طوق سے نجات حاصل نہیں کر پائے اسی لیئے دولت اور  مرتبے والوں کو خوشی خوشی اپنا لیڈر تسلیم کر کے ہر آن لٹنے اور برباد رہنے کو ترجیح دیتے ہیں.</p>\n\t\t\t<p>یہ پانامہ لیکس کا سکینڈل طاقت کے ایوانوں میں بچھی شطرنج پر محض چالیں یا زیادہ سے زیادہ مہرے تبدیل کرنے کے علاوہ کچھ بھی نہیں کرے گا.لیکن غلامی کے طوق کو خوشی خوشی گلے لگانے والوں کو اب یہ سوچنا ہو گا کہ آخر کب تلک یوں ہی ان رہزنوں کو رہنما سمجھ کر لٹتے ہی چلے جانا ہے.کب یہ سیدھی سی بات سمجھنی ہے کہ عام آدمی کے مسائل کا حل  وہی پیش کر سکتا ہے جو خود بل جمع کروانے  کی قطاروں میں کھڑے ہو کر انتطار کے کرب سے گزرا ہو جس نے سرکاری ہسپتالوں میں علاج معالجے کیلئے دھکے کھائے  ہوں جسے پتہ ہو کہ محدود آمدنی میں گزارا کس قدر مشکل ہوتا ہے نا کہ بنی گالی رائے ونڈ یا نوڈیرو کے محلات میں بسنے والی اشرافیہ جن کے کتوں کی زندگی بھی وطن عزیز میں بسنے والے کڑوڑہا سفید پوش آدمیوں سے بہتر ہوتی ہے</p>\n\t\t</section>\n\t</body>\n"

The source of bleeding was identified in 15/20 (75%): multiple angiodysplasias in four, arterial-venous malformation beyond the ligament of Treitz in two that could be treated with injection successfully. Other diagnoses included: duodenal adenocarcinoma, jejunal tuberculosis, erosions and ulcer of the jejunum. Of 24 patients with other indications, the diagnosis could be achieved in 18 of them (75%), including: two lymphomas, plasmocytoma, Gardner's syndrome, Peutz-Jeghers' syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis, Behçet's disease, jejunal submucosal lesion, lymphangiectasia due to blastomycosis and unspecific chronic jejunitis. Of three cases with Roux-en-Y reconstruction, two underwent DBE in order to perform biopsies of the excluded duodenum. Additionally, two patients underwent DBE to exclude Crohn's disease and lymphoma of the small bowel. The mean length of small bowel examination was 240 +/- 50 cm during a single approach. The diagnostic yield was 75% (33/44 cases) and therapeutic yield was 63.6%. No major complications were observed, only minor complication such as sore throat in 4/44 (9.1%).\"]",

The clotting profile in surgical bleeding after cardiac surgery influences further management. Aspiration and discard of a certain amount of blood from the line, prior to sampling, are assumed to clear heparin contamination. We have investigated this assumption through analysis of the clotting profile by simultaneous arterial line and peripheral venous samples.', 'The morning following cardiac surgery, simultaneous arterial line and peripheral venous blood samples were taken for activated plasma thromboplastin time (APTT) ratio and international normalized ratio (INR) in 49 randomly selected patients. Also, a thromboelastogram analysis (TEG) (n = 7) was made. A survey of 22 UK cardiothoracic intensive care units was carried out to determine the practice for the withdrawal of blood for clotting studies.', 'The median arterial APTT ratio value was 1.32 +/- 0.52 as compared to the median peripheral APTT ratio value which was 1.1 +/- 0.24 (P<0.001). INR values were statistically similar by both routes. Heparin contamination was confirmed by TEG which revealed that the R-value for arterial catheter blood samples without heparinase in the cup was higher (406.00 +/- 64.44 s) compared with the value for arterial samples with heparinase in the cup (318.28 +/- 47.26s, P<0.05). The survey of 22 UK cardiothoracic intensive care units showed that heparinized arterial lines were by far the commonest ports used for blood withdrawal for the measurement of APTT ratio results.']",

آیا اور اس نے کہا کہ میں اپنے آپ سے ایسی باتیں کرتا ہوں کہ میں ان کو بیان کرنے سے کوئلہ ہونے کو زیادہ پسند کروں گا۔ آپ نے فرمایا: اس اللہ کا شکر ہے جس نے اس کے معاملے کو وسوسے کا معاملہ بنا

</annotation>: لفظی مطلب ہے: اس نے اس کے معاملے کو لوٹا دیا۔ یہاں اس سے مراد ایک معاملے کو دوسری صورت دے دینا ہے۔</p>\n\t\t\t<heading>متون</heading>\n\t\t\t<p>یہ روایت مختلف الفاظ میں ملتی ہے، لیکن ان متون میں کوئی فرق ایسا نہیں ہے جو کسی بڑے معنوی فرق پر دلالت کرتا ہو۔ مثلاً بعض روایات میں ’<annotation lang=\"ar\">إنی أحدث نفسی بالشی‘ کے بجائے ’إنا أحدنا یجد فی نفسہ یعرض بالشی</annotation>‘ اور ’<annotation lang=\"ar\">إنی لأجد فی صدری الشء</annotation>‘ کے الفاظ آئے ہیں۔ لیکن یہ تینوں جملے ایک ہی مفہوم کے حامل ہیں۔ البتہ ایک روایت میں ’الشء‘ کے ساتھ ’من أمر الرب‘ کی وضاحت بھی بیان ہوئی ہے۔ یہ وضاحت کسی راوی کا اضافہ بھی ہو سکتی ہے۔ بعض روایات میں ’<annotation lang=\"ar\">لأن أکون حممۃ</annotation>‘ کے بجائے ’<annotation lang=\"ar\">لأن أخر من السماء</annotation>‘ کے الفاظ آئے ہیں۔ یہ دوسرا جملہ بھی شدت ندامت ہی کو ظاہر کرتا ہے۔ سوال کے ساتھ ساتھ حضور کا جواب بھی مختلف الفاظ میں روایت ہوا ہے۔ ایک روایت سے معلوم ہوتا ہے کہ نبی صلی اللہ علیہ وسلم نے ’<annotation lang=\"ar\">الحمد ﷲ</annotation>‘ کا کلمہ بولنے سے پہلے اپنی مسرت کو ’<annotation lang=\"ar\">اﷲ اکبر، اﷲ اکبر</annotation>‘ کہہ کر ظاہر کیا تھا۔ اس تفصیلی جواب کے برعکس ایک روایت یہ بتاتی ہے کہ آپ نے صرف ’ذاک صریح الایمان‘ کے الفاظ کہہ کر سائل کے صادق جذبے کی تصویب کی تھی۔ اس کے برعکس ایک روایت میں حضور کے جواب کے الفاظ یہ ہیں:’<annotation lang=\"ar\">إن الشیطان قد أیس من أن یعبد بأرضی ھذہ و لکنہ قد رضی بالمحقرات من أعمالکم</annotation>‘، (شیطان اس سے مایوس ہو چکا ہے کہ اس سر زمین میں اس کی پوجا کی جائے گی۔ البتہ، وہ تم سے چھوٹے گناہوں کے ارتکاب کے معاملے میں مطمئن ہے۔) یہ تمام جوابات بھی مختلف اسالیب میں ایک ہی حقیقت کا بیان ہیں۔ کچھ روایتوں میں ’<annotation lang=\"ar\">ردأمرہ</annotation>‘ کی جگہ ’<annotation lang=\"ar\">ردکیدہ</annotation>‘ کی ترکیب مروی ہے۔ ’<annotation lang=\"ar\">کید</annotation>‘ کا لفظ ’<annotation lang=\"ar\">امر</annotation>‘ کے مقابلے میں شیطانی در اندازی کے لیے زیادہ موزوں ہے۔</p>\n\t\t\t<heading>معنی</heading>\n\t\t\t<p>اس روایت میں دو باتیں بیان ہوئی ہیں۔ ایک یہ کہ آدمی کی سوچ اسے بسا اوقات انتہائی پر خطر وادیوں میں لے جاتی ہے۔ وہ ایسی باتیں سوچنے لگ جاتا ہے جنھیں بیان کرنا اسے بہت ہی ناگوار گزرتا ہے۔ یہاں تک کہ وہ یہ چاہنے لگتا ہے کہ اس پر آسمان گر جائے یا وہ جل کر راکھ ہو جائے، لیکن اس کی اس سوچ سے کوئی آگاہ نہ ہو۔ نبی صلی اللہ علیہ وسلم کے پاس آنے والا یہ سائل کسی ایسی ہی سوچ میں مبتلا ہو گیا تھا۔ چنانچہ اس نے نے آپ کے سامنے بھی اپنی سوچ بیان نہیں کی۔ صرف ایک سچے اور مخلص مؤمن کی طرح اپنی پریشانی بیان کی ہے۔ آپ صلی اللہ علیہ وسلم کے جواب سے یہ معلوم ہوتا ہے کہ سائل کی الجھن یہ تھی کہ کہیں اس طرح کی سوچ پر اس کی گرفت تو نہیں ہو گی۔ یعنی وہ کسی گناہ کا مرتکب تو نہیں ہو گیا ہے۔ اگرچہ اس روایت کے ایک متن میں یہ تصریح ہو گئی ہے کہ اس کی سوچ اللہ تعالیٰ کی ذات کے بارے میں تھی، لیکن اس تحدید کی کوئی اصولی اہمیت نہیں ہے۔ غلط، پر خطر اور بری سوچ کا دائرہ اللہ تعالیٰ کی ذات ہی سے متعلق نہیں ہے، بلکہ اس کی صفات، اس کے سنن، قانونِ آزمایش، پیغمبر صلی اللہ علیہ وسلم کی ذات، شخصیت، ان کی دی ہوئی تعلیمات، یعنی عقائد، شریعت اور اس سے آگے اخلاقی رویوں ہر ہر چیز پر محیط ہے۔ شیطان دین کی ہر چیز کے بارے میں شکوک و شبہات پیدا کرتا اور آدمی کے ایمان وعمل کو متزلزل کرنے کے درپے رہتا ہے۔ چنانچہ بندۂ مؤمن کا اپنی سوچ کے بارے میں حساس اور بیدا رہنا اس کے ایمان اور عمل کی حفاظت کے لیے بہت ضروری ہے۔ اس روایت میں دوسری بات یہ بیان ہوئی ہے کہ اس طرح کی سوچ پر گرفت کی نوعیت کیا ہے۔ سائل نے اپنی پریشانی بیان کرتے ہوئے یہ واضح کر دیا ہے کہ اسے اپنی یہ سوچ بہت ناگوار گزری ہے۔ یہاں تک کہ وہ اس سوچ کی اپنی ذات کے ساتھ نسبت کے ظاہر ہونے کو بھی کسی حال میں پسند نہیں کرے گا۔ نبی صلی اللہ علیہ وسلم نے اس کی پریشانی اور پشیمانی کی اس صورت کو دیکھ کر یک گونہ مسرت کا اظہار کیا ہے۔ اور اس کے اطمینان کے لیے یہ واضح فرما دیا ہے کہ اگر آدمی ذہن میں آنے والے غلط خیالات پر اس طرح پریشان اور پشیمان ہوتا ہے تو اللہ تعالیٰ اسے سوچ کے مضر اثرات سے بچا لیتے ہیں۔ یہ سوچ جہاں پیدا ہوتی ہے وہیں مرجھا کر مر جاتی ہے۔ یعنی ایمان و عمل کی خرابی کی صورت میں کوئی برگ و بار لائے بغیر اپنے انجام کو پہنچ جاتی ہے۔ نبی صلی اللہ علیہ وسلم نے فرمایا:جب یہ معاملہ ہو تو یہ سوچ محض وسوسہ ہے اور اس پر کوئی گرفت نہیں ہو گی۔ شارحین کے سامنے روایت کے جملے ’رد أمرہ‘ کے بارے میں یہ سوال ہے کہ اس میں وارد ترکیب ’أمرہ‘، کا مرجع کیا ہے۔ یعنی ”اس کے معاملے“ سے شیطان کا معاملہ مرادہے یا اشارہ بندۂ مومن کے معاملے کی طرف ہے۔ اوپر بیان کردہ تصریح سے واضح ہے کہ اس سے اشارہ بندۂ مومن ہی کی طرف ہے۔ اس روایت سے نکتے کی بات یہ سامنے آتی ہے کہ شیاطین نفسِ انسانی میں مختلف قسم کے خیا لات اور خواہشات کے وجود پذیر ہونے کا باعث بنتے رہتے ہیں۔ بندۂ مؤمن اگر اپنی باگ ان کے ہاتھ میں دے دے تو اس کا نتیجہ اس کے ایمان میں خرابی یا عمل میں برائی کی صورت میں نکلے گا۔ یہ چیز اسے گناہ گار بنا دے گی اور وہ اللہ تعالیٰ کی گرفت میں آجائے گا۔ اور اگر وہ ان خیالات یا خواہشات کو پوری طاقت سے رد کر دیتا ہے تو یہ چیز وسوسے سے آگے نہیں بڑھے گی اور وسوسے پر کوئی گرفت نہیں ہے۔</p>\n\t\t\t<heading>کتابیات</heading>\n\t\t\t<p>ابوداؤد، کتاب الادب، باب ۱۱۸۔ احمد، عنِ ابن عباس۔ تفسیر ابنِ کثیر، ج۴ ص۵۷۶۔ صحیح ابنِ حبان، ج۱۴، ص۶۷۔ موارد الظمان، ج۱، ص۴۱۔ مسندِ ابی عوانہ، ج۱،

الملک</annotation>‘ کے الفاظ روایت کیے گئے ہیں۔</p>\n\t\t\t<heading>معنی</heading>\n\t\t\t<p>بنیادی طور پر یہ روایت اس حقیقت کو واضح کرتی ہے کہ جہاں شیاطین انسانوں کے نفوس میں برائیوں کے لیے تحریک پیدا کرنے کی سعی کرتے ہیں وہیں فرشتے نیکیوں کے لیے آمادگی کا جذبہ ابھارنے کی کوشش کرتے ہیں۔ یہ بات ہم اس سے پہلے حدیث: ۶۷میں واضح کر چکے ہیں کہ یہ بات صرف حدیث ہی میں نہیں آئی ہے، بلکہ قرآنِ مجید میں بھی بیان ہو ئی ہے۔ چنانچہ یہ نکتہ تو ایک طے شدہ نکتہ ہے۔ اس روایت میں پیشِ نظر نکتہ شیطانی اور ملکوتی تاثیرات میں فرق اور نوعیت کو واضح کرنا ہے، تاکہ اہلِ ایمان شیطان کے اصل ہتھیار سے واقف ہو جائیں اور اس کا مقابلہ کرنا ان کے لیے آسان ہو۔ شیطان کا اصل حربہ یاس اور ناامیدی پیدا کر کے مستقبل کی ناکامیوں اور پیش آنے والی تکلیفوں کے خوف میں مبتلا کر کے برائی کے راستے پر لگانا ہے۔ اسی بات کو واضح کرنے کے لیے نبی صلی اللہ علیہ وسلم نے ’ایعاد بالشر‘ کی ترکیب اختیار کی ہے۔ انسانی فطرت صالح ہے۔ لہٰذا اس کا اصل میلان اعمالِ صالحہ ہی کی طرف ہے۔ یہ ایک مشکل کام ہے کہ انسان کو صحیح کاموں سے ہٹا کر برے کاموں کی طرف لگایا جائے۔ اس کے لیے ایک راستہ یہ ہے کہ آدمی کو مختلف اندیشوں میں مبتلا کر دیا جائے تاکہ وہ صحیح اصول پر فیصلہ کرنے کے بجائے مایوسی اور خوف کی حالت میں شیطان کا مطلوب فیصلہ کرے۔ شیطان کا دوسرا حربہ انسان کے جنسی جذبے کو بے راہ رو کرنا ہے۔ جنسی جذبے کو قابو کرنے میں حیا کے جذبے کو مؤثر ترین عامل کی حیثیت حاصل ہے۔ شیطان کی کوشش یہ ہوتی ہے کہ وہ اس جذبے کو غیر مؤثر کر دے تاکہ انسان بے حیائی کی راہ پر چلنے میں عار محسوس نہ کرے اور نتیجۃً معاشرے میں فحاشی پھیل جائے۔ فرشتے اس کے برعکس انسان کو امید دلاتے ہیں۔ اسے خدا کی رحمت اور مغفرت پانے کی طرف راغب کرتے ہیں۔ امید آدمی کی مثبت سرگرمیوں کا منبع ہے۔ یہی وجہ ہے کہ فرشتے ناامیدی کی کیفیت پیدا کرنے کے بجائے آدمی کی توجہ خدا کی رحمتوں کی طرف متوجہ کرتے ہیں۔ مایوسی کے نتیجے میں آدمی کفر کی راہ اختیار کرتا اور خدا کی رحمت کے بھروسے پر آدمی حق کو اختیار کرتا اور اس کے نتیجے میں آنے والی مشکلات اور مصیبتوں کو دیکھ کر اس کے قدم متزلزل نہیں ہوتے۔</p>\n\t\t\t<heading>کتابیات</heading>\n\t\t\t<p>ترمذی، کتاب تفسیر القرآن، باب ۳۔ تفسیر

Cohesive tensile strength testing directly supported these morphologic findings as the stronger, more rigid regions of the cornea were located anteriorly and peripherally. This suggests that PRK and ASA, and secondarily SBK, should be biomechanically safer than conventional LASIK with regard to risk for causing keratectasia after surgery. Because adult human corneal stromal wounds heal slowly and incompletely, all excimer laser keratorefractive surgical techniques still have some distinct disadvantages due to inadequate reparative wound healing. Despite reducing some of the risk for corneal haze compared to conventional PRK, ASA cases still can develop corneal haze or breakthrough haze from the hypercellular fibrotic stromal scarring.

This study was conducted to assess these questions in a resource-limited setting.', 'We performed a retrospective observational study of HIV-infected patients diagnosed in the pre-HAART era on follow-up at a private center from Buenos Aires, Argentina. Socio-demographic, clinical, and laboratory data were extracted from clinical charts. Analyses were performed to test for potential associations of selected variables with current virologic failure or use of third-line drugs.', 'Of 619 patients on follow-up, 82 (13.2%) were diagnosed in the pre-HAART era. At the time of our study, 79 (96.3%) patients were on HAART, with a median duration of 14 years (IQR 12-15) of therapy, and exposure to mono or dual nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors regimens in 47.8% of cases.\\xa0Sixty-nine patients (87.3%) had undetectable VL, 37 (46.8%) never presented virologic failure, and 19 (24.1%) experienced only one failure. Thirteen patients (16.5%) were receiving third-line ART regimens, with an average of 2.7-fold more virologic failures than those on first- or second-line regimens (p = 0.007).']",

The prostate cancer detection rate of systematic 12-core transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy is between 30% and 40%. For prostates greater than 40 cc this decreases to 30% or less. Magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy has shown superior prostate cancer detection rates. We defined the detection rate of magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy in men with an enlarged prostate gland.', 'We retrospectively analyzed the records of patients who underwent multiparametric prostate magnetic resonance imaging followed by magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion biopsy at our institution. Whole prostate volumes were calculated using magnetic resonance imaging reconstructions. Detection rates were analyzed with respect to age, prostate specific antigen and whole prostate volumes. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess these parameters as independent predictors of prostate cancer detection.', 'We analyzed 649 patients with a mean±SD age of 61.8±7.9 years and a median prostate specific antigen of 6.65 ng/ml (IQR 4.35-11.0). Mean whole prostate volume was 58.7±34.3 cc. The overall detection rate of the magnetic resonance-ultrasound fusion platform was 55%. For prostates less than 40 cc the detection rate was 71.1% compared to 57.5%, 46.9%, 46.9% 33.3%, 36.4% and 30.4% for glands 40 to 54.9, 55 to 69.9, 70 to 84.9, 85 to 99.9, 100 to 114.9 and 115 cc or greater, respectively (p<0.0001).

Multiple emergency medicine and critical care studies have shown that lung-protective ventilation protocols reduce morbidity and mortality. Our primary objective was to determine if a group of EMS professionals could provide ventilations with a smaller BVM that would be sufficient to ventilate patients. Secondary objectives included 1) if the pediatric bag provided volumes similar to lung-protective ventilation in the hospital setting and 2) compare volumes provided to the patient depending on the type of airway (mask, King tube, and intubation).', 'Using a patient simulator of a head and thorax that was able to record respiratory rate, tidal volume, peak pressure, and minute volume via a laptop computer, participants were asked to ventilate the simulator during six 1-minute ventilation tests. The first scenario was BVM ventilation with an oropharyngeal airway in place ventilating with both an adult- and pediatric-sized BVM, the second scenario had a supraglottic airway and both bags, and the third scenario had an endotracheal tube and both bags. Participants were enrolled in convenience manner while they were on-duty and the research staff was able to travel to their stations.

A greater percentage of breaths delivered in the recommended range occurred when the pediatric BVM was used (17.5% vs 5.1%, p<0.001). Median volumes for each scenario were 570.5mL, 664.0mL, 663.0mL for the pediatric BMV and 796.0mL, 994.5mL, 981.5mL for the adult BVM.

The prevalence of some chronic conditions, such as congestive heart failure, ischemic heart disease, and stroke/transient ischemic attack, decreased. The deterioration of average health was due to other chronic conditions: chronic kidney disease, depression, diabetes, osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis/osteoarthritis.

P\\u2009≤\\u20090.05 was considered significant.', 'The study included 1772 female and 289 male patients. The mean age for male patients was 44.07\\u2009±\\u200911.91 years compared to 41.29\\u2009±\\u200912.18 years for female patients (P\\u2009=\\u20090.706). Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was successfully completed in 1996 patients. The conversion rate was higher in men (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001), and the mean operating time was longer in men (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001). Bile duct injuries occurred more frequently in men (P\\u2009<\\u20090.001). Gallbladder perforation and gallstone spillage also occurred more commonly in men (P\\u2009=\\u20090.001); similarly severe inflammation was reported more in male patients (P\\u2009=\\u20090001). There were no statistically significant differences in mean hospital stay, wound infection and port-site herniation between men and women. Multivariate regression analysis showed that the male sex is an independent risk factor for conversion to open cholecystectomy (odds ratio\\u2009=\\u20092.65, 95% confidence interval: 1.03-6.94, P\\u2009=\\u20090.041) and biliary injuries (odds ratio\\u2009=\\u20090.95, 95% confidence interval: 0.91-0.99, P-value\\u2009=\\u20090.036).']",

کہنا تھا کہ ہندوستانی جاسوس کی گرفتاری کا معاملہ پاک ایران تعلقات سے نہ جوڑا جائے۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>اسلام آباد میں پریس کانفرنس سے خطاب کرتے ہوئے وفاقی وزیر داخلہ چوہدری نثار علی خان نے کہا کہ گرفتار 'را' ایجنٹ کلبھوشن یادیو کا مسئلہ پاکستان اور ہندوستان کے درمیان ہے، اسے ایران سے نہ جوڑا جائے۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>چوہدری نثار نے کہا کہ یہ بات غلط ہے کہ ایران, پاکستان میں دہشت گردی کے لیے سہولت کار کا کردار ادا کر رہا ہے یاد رہے کہ 'ایران پاکستان کے خلاف منفی سرگرمیوں میں ملوث نہیں'۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>وفاقی وزیر داخلہ کا یہ بھی کہنا تھا کہ ان کی ایرانی سفیر سے تفصیلی بات ہوئی ہے اور انھوں نے پاکستان کو برادر ملک قرار دیا ہے۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p><annotation lang=\"en\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDOOe6NucQM</annotation></p>\n\t\t\t<p>ایرانی صدر کے دورہ پاکستان کو مثبت قرار دیتے ہوئے انہوں نے کہا کہ ایران نے ہر مشکل وقت میں پاکستان کا ساتھ دیا ہے۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>خیال رہے کہ گذشتہ ماہ ایرانی صدر حسن روحانی کے دورہ پاکستان کے موقع پر پاک فوج کے شعبہ تعلقات عامہ آئی ایس پی آر نے اپنے ایک جاری بیان میں دعویٰ کیا تھا کہ پاک فوج کے سربراہ جنرل راحیل شریف اور ایرانی صدر کے درمیان ہونے والی ملاقات میں ہندوستان کی خفیہ ایجنسی 'را' کے بلوچستان سے گرفتار ہونے والے ایجنٹ کے حوالے سے بات چیت ہوئی ہے۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>تاہم ایرانی صدر نے بعد ازاں ایک پریس کانفرنس میں اس کی تردید کرتے ہوئے کہا تھا کہ ان کی جنرل راحیل شریف سے ملاقات میں 'را' ایجنٹ پر بات چیت نہیں ہوئی۔</p>\n\t\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\t\t<p>پرویز مشرف معاملہ</p>\n\t\t\t</blockquote>\n\t\t\t<p>ڈان نیوز کے مطابق وفاقی وزیر داخلہ چوہدری نثار کا کہنا تھا کہ سابق صدر پرویز مشرف کے معاملے پر ایک یا دو روز میں حقائق عوام کے سامنے لائے جائیں گے۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>وفاقی وزیر داخلہ نے کہا کہ ملک میں سچ بولنا نا ممکن ہو گیا ہے اور بہت سے لوگوں کو ان پر تنقید کرنے کا شوق ہے، 'جھوٹ بولنے والے خاندانی جھوٹے ہیں'۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>پرویز مشرف کے معاملے پر تحریری ریکارڈ میڈیا کے سامنے لانے کا دعویٰ کرتے ہوئے وفاقی وزیر داخلہ نے کہا کہ پرویز مشرف کا نام سپریم کورٹ کے فیصلے کے مطابق ای سی ایل میں ڈالا گیا تھا، حکومت کسی کوازخود ای سی ایل پر نہیں رکھ سکتی، ' ماضی میں حکومت پرویز مشرف کی بیرون ملک جانے کی 3 اپیلیں مسترد کر چکی ہے'۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>انھوں نے حیرت کا اظہار کرتے ہوئے کہا کہ پرویز مشرف کے معاملے میں حکومت کو تنقید کا نشانہ بنانے والی پیپلز پارٹی کے پاس آیان علی کے کیس کی پیروی کیلئے وکلاء ہیں تاہم پرویز مشرف کے کیس کے لیے نہیں ہیں؟ ، پیپلز پارٹی والے پرویز مشرف کے معاملے پر 5 سال سے سو رہے تھے؟</p>\n\t\t\t<p>وفاقی وزیر نے کہا کہ وہ خصوصی عدالت کے ریمارکس پر حیران اور پریشان ہوئے تھے اور اگر عدالتی مراحل میں تاخیر ہوئی ہے تو اس میں حکومت کی کیا غلطی ہے۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>یاد رہے کہ گذشتہ ماہ سپریم کورٹ نے سندھ ہائی کورٹ کے فیصلے کو برقرار رکھتے ہوئے سابق صدر پرویز مشرف کا نام ای سی ایل سے نکلنے کی ہدایت کی تھی جس کے بعد پریوز مشرف علاج کیلئے بیرون ملک چلے گئے۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>پیپلز پارٹی نے سابق صدر پرویز مشرف کے علاج کیلئے بیرون ملک جانے کو تنقید کا نشانہ بناتے ہوئے ایک ڈیل قرار دیا تھا۔</p>\n\t\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\t\t<p>ممتاز قادری کے حق میں اسلام آباد میں دھرنا</p>\n\t\t\t</blockquote>\n\t\t\t<p>دارالحکومت اسلام آباد ڈی چوک پر مذہبی جماعتوں کے دھرنے کی تفصیلات کے حوالے سے وفاقی وزیر داخلہ چوہدری نثار نے کہا کہ دھرنے والوں نے پنجاب حکومت سے اسلام آباد نہ جانے کے معاہدے کی خلاف ورزی کی تھی۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>انھوں ںے کہا کہ قانون توڑنے والوں کو بخشا نہیں جائے گا اور قانونی شکنی کرنے والے ایک ایک شخص کو گرفتار کیا جائے گا۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>وفاقی وزیر داخلہ نے کہا کہ حکومت ڈی چوک پر نفرت انگیز تقاریر کرنے والوں کو نہیں چھوڑے گی۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>یہ بھی یاد رہے کہ گذشتہ ہفتے سابق گورنر پنجاب سلمان تاثیر کو قتل کرنے والے ممتاز قادری کی سزائے موت کے بعد ان چہلم کے موقع پر چند مذہبی کے سیکٹروں رہنماؤں اور کارکنوں نے اسلام آباد ڈی چوک پر احتجاج کرتے ہوئے دھرنا دے دیا تھا۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>تحریک لبیک یارسول اللہؐ کی قیادت میں مظاہرین نے حکومت کو 10 مطالبات پیش کیے۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>ان مطالبات میں زیر حراست کارکنوں اور مذہبی رہنماؤں کی غیر مشروط رہائی، ان کے خلاف دہشت گردی اور قتل کی دفعات کے تحت تمام مقدمات واپس لینے، ممتاز قادری کو شہید کا درجہ دینے، ان کے اڈیالہ جیل کے سیل کو قومی ورثے کا درجہ دینے، توہین مذہب کے قانون میں ترمیم نہ کرنے کی یقین دہانی، جبکہ احمدیوں اور دیگر غیر مسلموں کو اہم عہدوں سے ہٹانے کے مطالبات شامل تھے۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>دھرنے کے شرکا کی جانب سے توہین مذہب کی ملزم عاسیہ بی بی کو پھانسی دیے جانے کا مطالبہ بھی کیا گیا۔</p>\n\t\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\t\t<p>آرمی چیف سے ملاقات</p>\n\t\t\t</blockquote>\n\t\t\t<p>وفاقی وزیر داخلہ چوہدری نثار نے وزیر اعلیٰ پنجاب شہباز شریف اور ان کی جنرل راحیل سے خفیہ ملاقات کی خبروں کو بے بنیاد قرار دیتے ہوئے کہا کہ ان کی ملاقات 'معمول کے مطابق اور دن کی روشنی میں ہوئی تھی'۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>اسلام آباد میں پریس کانفرنس سے خطاب کرتے ہوئے چوہدری نثار نے کہا تھا کہ 'ہمیں جنرل راحیل شریف نے خفیہ ملاقات کرنے کی ضرورت نہیں ہے'۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>ان کا کہنا تھا کہ کچھ اخبارات میں اس حوالے سے شائع ہونے والی خبریں بے بنیاد ہیں۔</p>\n\t\t\t<blockquote>\n\t\t\t\t<p>پاکستانی کرکٹ ٹیم پر تبصرہ</p>\n\t\t\t</blockquote>\n\t\t\t<p>پریس کانفرنس کے دوران صحافیوں کے سوالات کا جواب دیتے ہوئے چوہدری نثار نے اپنے ماتحت افسران سے سرگوشی کرتے ہوئے کہا کہ کسی صحافی سے کہو کہ کرکٹ کے حوالے سے سوال کرے۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>اس دوران مائیک قرب ہونے کی وجہ سے وزیر داخلہ کی آواز باآسانی لائیو نشر ہو گئی۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>ماتحت افسر کی جانب سے جواب پر وفاقی وزیر داخلہ نے غصے سے کہا کہ 'کسی اور سے کہو کہ سوال پوچھ لے'۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>اس کے بعد ایک صحافی کی جانب سے کرکٹ پر پوچھے گئے ایک سوال کے جواب میں چوہدری نثار نے کہا کہ وہ اپنے وعدے پر قائم ہیں کہ ایشیا کپ میں پاکستانی کرکٹ ٹیم کی خراب کارکردگی کے حوالے سے کمیٹی کی رپورٹ ٹی ٹوئنٹی ورلڈ کپ کے بعد منظر عام پر لائی جائے گی۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>'تاہم قوم کی طرح مجھے بھی ٹی ٹوئنٹی ورلڈ کپ میں ٹیم کی خراب کارکردگی پر افسوس ہوا ہے، مذکورہ رپورٹ تو لیک ہو چکی ہے اب کیا سامنے آنا باقی ہے؟'</p>\n\t\t</section>\n\t</body>\n"

To accurately assess differences in the behavior of the participant between these treatment conditions, the therapist followed a strict research protocol. The behavior of the participant was continuously video-recorded during both treatment conditions for further analysis and comparison. Treatment outcomes: In the presence of the dog, the participant exhibited more frequent and longer durations of positive behaviors (such as smiling and positive physical contacting) as well as less frequent and shorter durations of negative behaviors (such as aggressive manifestations).']",

Complete clinical charts were reviewed by a pediatric hematologist with training in infectious diseases to determine a clinical standard to define the presence or absence of osteomyelitis. A pediatric radiologist reviewed all MR imaging and was blinded to clinical information. Based on the signal intensity in T1-W fat-saturated images, the children were further classified as positive for osteomyelitis (low bone marrow signal intensity) or positive for bone infarct (high bone marrow signal intensity).', 'Based on the clinical standard, 5 children were classified as positive for osteomyelitis and 26 children as positive for bone infarct (negative for osteomyelitis).

The heterozygous CYP2D6*4 group also displayed lower values in patients than in controls but the difference was not significant (OR=0.698, p=0.28).

The mean operative time was 41 minutes. There were no conversions to open procedures. There was no bleeding, no visceral injury, and no mortality. There was one admission directly from the day surgical unit (admission rate of 0.6%), but no readmission following discharge. No patients were admitted due to postoperative nausea or pain. Ninety-nine (66%) of 150 patients responded to our questionnaire: 97% were satisfied about the information they had received.

In addition, it is accepted that a small percentage of ET patients presenting symptoms and signs of possible PD may progress finally to a typical pattern of parkinsonism. Ioflupane, N-u-fluoropropyl-2a-carbomethoxy-3a-(4-iodophenyl) nortropane, also called FP-CIT, labelled with (123)I (commercially known as DaTSCAN) has been proven to be useful in the differential diagnosis between PD and ET and to confirm dopaminergic degeneration in patients with parkinsonism. The aim of this study is to identify dopaminergic degeneration in patients with PD and distinguish them from others with ET using semi-quantitative SPECT (123)I-Ioflupane (DaTSCAN) data in comparison with normal volunteers (NV), in addition with the respective ones of patients referred as suffering from ET, as well as, of patients with a PD diagnosis at an initial stage with a unilateral presentation of motor signs.\", 'Twenty-eight patients suffering from ET (10 males plus 18 females) and 28 NV (12 males and 16 females) were enroled in this study. In addition, 33 patients (11 males and 22 females) with an established diagnosis of PD with unilateral limb involvement (12 left hemi-body and 21 right hemi-body) were included for comparison with ET. We used DaTSCAN to obtain SPECT images and measure the radiopharmaceutical uptake in the striatum (S), as well as the caudate nucleus (CN) and putamen (P) in all individuals.', 'Qualitative (Visual) interpretation of the SPECT data did not find any difference in the uptake of the radiopharmaceutical at the level of the S, CN and P between NV and ET patients. Reduced accumulation of the radiopharmaceutical uptake was found in the P of all PD patients. Semiquantitative analysis revealed significant differences between NV and ET patients in the striatum, reduced in the latter. There was also a significant reduction in the tracer accumulation in the left putamen of patients with right hemi-parkinsonism compared to ET and NV. Patients with left hemi-parkinsonism, demonstrated reduced radioligand uptake in the right putamen in comparison with ET and NV. Clinical follow-up of 20 patients with ET at (so many months afterwards) revealed no significant change in clinical presentation, particularly no signs of PD. Follow-up DaTSCAN performed in 10 of them (so many months afterwards) was negative in all but one. This one had an equivocal baseline study which deteriorated 12\\xa0months later.']",

Compared with other studies of refusers, relatively more information could be gathered with regard to both their characteristics and reasons for refusing, because all potential participants were invited personally.', 'Older patients from a Dutch outpatient clinic were invited to participate in a self-management intervention, and their characteristics were assessed. Demographic data were collected, as well as data on physical functioning and lack of emotional support. People who refused to participate were asked to give their reasons for refusing.', 'Of the 361 patients invited, 267 (74%) refused participation. These refusers were more restricted in their mobility, lived further away from the location of the intervention, and had a partner more often than did the participants.

Patients identified as possible acute hepatitis C were re-interviewed and all other sources such as blood bank records and pre-employment check-ups reviewed in order to establish the diagnosis of acute hepatitis C infection and to identify the transmission route.', 'Twenty-nine patients were found to have acute hepatitis C, representing 0.75% of all new referrals for hepatitis C. The most frequent (65%) mode of transmission was iatrogenic involving several, often minimal, procedures and clinical settings. The group in which iatrogenic transmission was suspected was older and the patients more often in monogamous relationship compared with other transmission routes groups.

The study sample included women ages 15-44 who were surgically sterile from a tubal sterilization at the time of interview. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between a history of unintended pregnancy and desire for sterilization reversal while controlling for potential confounders.', 'In this nationally representative sample of 1,418 women who were sterile from a tubal sterilization, 78% had a history of at least one unintended pregnancy and 28% expressed a desire to have their sterilization reversed. In unadjusted analysis, having a prior unintended pregnancy was associated with higher odds of expressing desire for sterilization reversal (odds ratio [OR]: 1.80; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.15-2.79).

ہیںخود پاکستان کے اندر وفاقی اور صوبائی حکومتوں کے درمیان ایک طرح کی کشمکش اوررسہ کشی جاری ہے۔ ایک عام شہری کی نگاہ میں پاک چین اقتصادی راہداری <annotation lang=\"en\">KKH</annotation> کا دوسرا نام ہے جسے مذید توسیع دیکر اور بہتر بنا کر اس قابل بنایا جائیگا کہ اس پر سے بھاری گاڑیاںآسانی اور محفوظ طریقے سے چلائی جاسکیںیا پھر چین اور پاکستان کے درمیان <annotation lang=\"en\">KKH</annotation> کے متوازی ر یلوے لائن بچھائی جائیگی ۔ دنیا میں زمانہ قدیم سے ملکی معشیت اور تجارت کے لئے مواصلات کو بنیادی اہمیت دی جارہی ہے ۔ جن ملکوں میں زمینی مواصلات کا نظام اچھاہوتاہے تو وہ ملک اقتصادی لحاظ سے اُن ملکوں کے مقابلے میں جن میں موصلاتی نظام ناقص یا ناکافی ہوتا ہے ۔بہت زیادہ مظبوط اورطاقتور ہوتے ہیں۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>قراقرم ہائے وے <annotation lang=\"en\">(KKH)</annotation> کی تعمیر سے پہلے گلگت بلتستان میں مواصلات نام کی کوئی چیز نہیں تھی۔ پہاڑی علاقہ ہونے کی وجہ سے سڑکیں بنانا مشکل تھا صرف چھوٹے چھوٹے راستوں سے کام لیا جاتا تھا جن پر انسان پیدل جل سکتا تھا یا زیادہ سے زیادہ گدھے ، گھوڑے وغیرہ چل سکتے تھے۔ 1947ء سے پہلے گلگت بلتستان کا اندورنی اورپاکستان ،چین، اور جموں و کشمیر کے ساتھ پہاڑی دروں سے گزرنے والے تنگ اور مشکل راستوں کے ذرئعے ہوا کرتا تھا،جسے عالمی سطح پر سلک روٹ کے نا م سے جانا جاتا تھا۔ یہ روٹ ایک طرف گلگت سے نگر ،ہنزہ وہوتے ہوئے خنجراب سے گزر کر کاشغرجاتا تھا دوسری طرف گلگت سے استور ہوتاہوا جموں و کشمیر جاتا تھا اور تیسری طرف سے چلاس اور بابوسر سے ہوتا ہوا خیبر پختونخواہ جاتا تھا۔ جن پر انسان یا تو پیدل سفر کر سکتا تھا یا پھر زیادہ سے زیادہ گھوڑے ، گدھے اور خچروں پر۔ <annotation lang=\"en\">KKH</annotation> کی تعمیر کے بعد ابتدائی دور میں چھوٹی گاڑیاں چلنا شروع ہوئیں خاص کر ولس جیپیں اور ٹریکٹر وغیرہ۔ اب جبکہ <annotation lang=\"en\">KKH</annotation> پوری طرح سے تعمیر ہو چکا ہے اس پر نہ صرف ٹرک اور بسیں چلنے لگی ہیں بلکہ 12 ویلر ٹرالر ز بھی چلنے لگے ہیں۔ جن کے ذریعے ہزاروں ،لاکھوں ٹن مال سالانہ چین سے پاکستان اور پاکستان سے چین لایا اور لے جایا جاتا ہے ۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>پاک چین اقتصادی راہداری کی تعمیر سے چین اور پاکستان کے درمیان نہ صرف 20 ویلر ٹرالرزگزرسکیں گے بلکہ ریل بھی چلائی جا سکے گی۔اس کے علاوہ ان کے متوازی گیس،تیل اورفائبر کی ترسیل کے لئے پائپ بھی بچھائی جا سکے گی۔ اس راہداری کی تعمیر سے نہ صرف پاکستان اور چین کے درمیان تجارتیحجم میں ہزاروں گنااضافہ ہوگا بلکہ وسط ایشیا برصغیر اور عرب ملکوں میں بھی معاشی انقلاب آجائیگا۔ دیکھنا یہ ہے کہ یہ راہداری کہاں سے شروع ہوگی کہاں کہاں سے گزرے گی اور کہا ں کہاں تک جائیگی۔ ابتداءمیں یہ کاشغر سے شروع ہوگی نگرہنزہ سے ہوتے ہوئے اور گلگت سے دریا سندھ کے ساتھ گزرتے ہوئے کراچی اور گودار تک جائیگی۔گوادر اور کراچی سے ہوتے ہوئے کوئٹہ سے گزرتے ہوئے تفتان ایران تک اورا دھر لاہور سے واگہ اور گنڈا سنگھ والا سے ہوتے ہوئے بھارت جائے گی۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>پاک چین راہداری کی تعمیر اور اس کی گزرنے کی جگہوں کے بارے میں جہاںوفاقی اور صوبائی حکومتوں کے درمیان غلط فہمیاں اور تحفظات پائے جاتے ہیں وہاں پر گلگت بلتستان کے لوگوں میں بھی مختلف شکوک و شبہات اور تحفظات سر اُٹھانے لگے ہیں۔ صوبوں کی طرح گلگت بلتستان کے تحفظات کو اگر دور کئے بغیر راہداری کی تعمیر شروع کی جاتی ہے تو وفاقی حکومت کو مشکلات کا سامنا کرنا پڑیگا۔ اس کی تعمیر میں مسائل اور رکاوٹیں پیدا ہو سکتی ہیں ۔جہاں تک پاکستانی صوبوں اور گلگت بلتستان کے راہداری پر تحفظات کا تعلق ہے تو یہ یکسر مختلف ہیں ۔صوبوںکو اگر اعتراض ہے تو اس کے گزرنے کے مقامات اور اس سے حاصل ہونے والے اقتصادی مفادت سے متعلق ہیں مگر گلگت بلتستان کے تحفظات علاقے کی آئینی حیثیت کے تعین اور اس کے غیر یقینی مستقبل کے بارے میں ہیں ۔</p>\n\t\t\t<blockquote>گلگت بلتستان ، پاکستان کی آئینی ،سیاسی اور جغرافیائی حصہ نہیں ۔اس بد قسمت علاقے کو یہاں کے لوگوں کی خواہش اورمخلصانہ پیشکش کے باوجود پاکستانی حکمرانوں نے اس کو پاکستان میں شامل کر کے اس کا آئینی حصہ بنانا ضروری نہیں سمجھا ۔نہ صرف ضروری نہیںسمجھا بلکہ اس کی آزادی بھی چھینکراور انفرادی حیثیت بھی ختم کر کے کشمیر کا حصہ تسلیم کرتے ہوئے ہمیشہ ہمیشہ کے لئے بھارت کے ساتھ متنازعہ بھی بنا دیا ہے۔ اس لحاظ سے پاکستان کو گلگت بلتستان سے راہداری گزارنے کا کوئی قانونی حق نہیں۔ گلگت بلتستان سے اگر راہداری کو گزارنا ہے تو یہاں کے لوگوں کی منظوری سے ہی گزارنا ہوگی اور یہ بھی دو ریاستوںاور فریقوں کے درمیاں معاہدے کی شکل میں بالکل ویسا ہی معاہدہ جیسا 1935ء کو انگریزوں اور مہاراجہ کشمیر کے درمیان معاہدہ گلگت ہوا تھا۔ انگریز، روس کی گرم پانیوںتک رسائی کی کوشش کو ناکام بنانا چاہتا تھا اور یہ صرف اسی صورت ہی ممکن ہوسکتاتھا کہ گلگت سے ملحقہ علاقے چلاس ،نگر، ہنزہ اور غذر میں انگریز موجود ہوں۔اپنی موجودگی کو قانونی شکل دینے کے لئے انگریزوں کو 60 سال کے لئے گلگت ایجنسی کولیز پر لینا پڑا۔ پاکستانی حکمرانوں نے گلگت بلتستان کو نہ تو پاکستان کا ریاستی حصہ بنایا ہے اور نہ ہی اسے یہاں کے لوگوں کے ساتھ کسی معاہدے کے تحت اس پر تصرف کا حق حاصل کیا ہے البتہ زبردستی سے اس کا نظم و نسق اپنے ہاتوں میں لے رکھا ہے۔کسی علاقے کا کسی ریاست کا یا ملک کا آئینی حصہ ہونا اور بات ہے۔لیزپر لینا اوراسکو زیر انتظام رکھنا اور بات ہے۔</blockquote>\n\t\t\t<p>گلگت بلتستان کے لوگوں کو پاک چین اقتصادی راہداری کی تعمیر پر کوئی اعتراض نہیں اگر یہ گلگت بلتستان کے علاوہ کسی اور جگہ سے بنائی جاتی ہے ۔اور اگر اسے گلگت بلتستان کے سینے سے ہی گزارنا ہے تو پھر یہاں کے لوگوں اور نمائندوں ،صوبائی حکومتی نمائندوں گلگت بلتستان کے عوامی نمائندوں جن کو نمبردار علاقے کے بزرگ اور معتبر کہاجاتاہے ۔کے ساتھ باقائدہ معاہدے کے ساتھ تعمیر کی جائے۔ علاوہ اس کے اگر حکمران راہداری کو گلگت بلتستان سے گزارنے پر بضد ہیں تو یہاں کے لوگوں کی مجبوری ہوگی کہ وہ اس کی بھر پور مذاحمت کریں ۔ راہداری کی تعمیر پر گلگت بلتستان کے تمام لوگوںکواور بلخصوص اکثریتی مکتب فکر کے کئی تحفظات ہیں ۔ اور ان کے تحفظات کی وجہ حکمرانوں کا آزادی سے لیکر اب تک ان کے ساتھ روا رکھا جانیوالا نا مناسب، متعصبانہ اور معاندانہ سلوک اور طرز عمل ہے ۔ خاص کر 1988 ء کے بعد پاکستانی حکمران بخوبی جانتے ہیں کہ وہ گلگت بلتستان سے راہداری نہیں گزارسکتے اس لئے کہ یہ متنازعہ علاقہ ہے جسے انہوں نے خود متنازعہ بنایا ہے یہاں کے لوگوں نے نہیں۔ حکمران اپنی اس غلطی کے ازالہ کے لئے نہیں بلکہ اپنے منصوبے پر عمل در آمد کرنے کے لئے ایک ایسے منصوبے پر غور کر رہی ہے جو نہ صرف ناقابل عمل ہے بلکہ انتہائی خطرناک اور تباہ کن بھی ہے۔ منصوبے کے مطابق گلگت بلتستان کو دو حصوں میں بانٹ کر ایک حصے کو پاکستان کا حصہ بنانا اور دوسرے حصے کو متنازعہ ہی رہنے دیناہے۔یعنی چلاس، گلگت ،نگر ہنزہ اور غذر کو غیر متنازعہ قرار دیکر پاکستان میں شامل کرنا اور استور اور بلتستان ریجن کو متنازعہ قرار دیکر آزاد کشمیر کے ساتھ ملانے یا پھرحسب سابق اسی طرح متنازعہ رکھنا ہے۔حکومت کی طرف سے اس انوکھے اچھوتے اور نادر منصوبے کو وفاقی سطح پر منظر عام پر لانے سے پہلے غالباً گلگت</p>\n\t\t\t<p>بلتستان کا ردِعمل معلوم کرنے کی غرض سے وزیر اعلیٰ گلگت بلتستان کی زبان سے اخباری بیان کے ذریعے کرایا ہے۔ وفاقی حکومت کی ہدایت پر وزیر اعلیٰ گلگت بلتستان حفیظ الرحمان نے اس منصوبے کو منظر عام پر لانے سے پہلے صوبائی حکومت کی طرف سے ایک آل پارٹیز کانفرنس کرائی تھی اور اس میں صرف یہی ایک ایجنڈا رکھا گیا تھا کہ گلگت بلتستان کا مستقبل کیا ہونا چائیے ۔ باالفاظ دیگر عرف عام میں گلگت بلتستان کی آئینی حیثیت کیا ہونی چائیے۔اس کانفرنس میں گلگت بلتستان میں موجود تقریباً تمام وفاقی ،سیاسی جماعتوں اور مقامی قوم پرست جماعتوں کے نمائندوں نے شرکت کی تھی ۔کانفرنس کے شر کاءحسب سابق کسی ایک نقطہ پر متفق نہیںہو سکے البتہ معمولی اکثیریت کے ذریعے اس بات پر اتفاق ہوا تھا کہ گلگت بلتستان کو پاکستان کا باقائدہ آئینی صوبہ بنایا جائے۔ اسی بنیاد پر ہی پی ایم ایل (ن) کے رکن اور سپیکر صوبائی اسمبلی فدا محمد ناشاد نے قرارداد پڑھی اور از خود اسے پاس بھی کیا۔ وزیر اعلیٰ اسی قرار داد کو لیکر وفاقی حکومت سے ملے اور اسے پیش کیا۔ وفاقی حکومت بخوبی جانتی ہے کہ وہ گلگت بلتستان کو کسی صورت میں بھی پاکستان میں آئینی طور پر ضم نہیں کر سکتی ۔اگر یہ ایسا کرنے کی حماقت کرتی ہے تو اسے نصف صدی سے زیادہ عرصے سے جاری و ساری تنازعہ کشمیر سے دست بردارہونا پڑے گااورنہ صرف مقبوضہ کشمیر بلکہ آزاد کشمیر اور گلگت بلتستان سے بھی ہاتھ دھونا پڑیگا۔ اور اگر ایسا نہیں کرسکتاہے ۔۔۔۔!یقینا ایسا نہیں کر سکتا ہے تو متنازعہ علاقے سے راہداری نہیں گزارسکتا ہے ۔ وفاقی حکمرانوں کی مثال اُس شخص کی سی ہے جو اپنی منزل کو کھو چکا ہے ۔ منزل کا راستہ بھول چکاہے اور ا یسے راستے پر چل پڑا ہے جس کے آگے اژدھا بیٹھا ہے اور پیچھے گہرا سمندر ہے۔ آگے جاتا ہے تو اژدھا کا لغمہ بنتا ہے اورپیچھے ہٹتا تو ہے تو سمندری موجوں اور شارکوں کا شکار ہوتا ہے ۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>وفاقی حکمرانوں نے اپنی مشکل دور کرنے اور اژدھا اور سمندر سے بچنے کے لئے اپنے ہی زم میں ایک محفوظ راستہ نکالنے کی کوشش کی ہے مگروہ نہیں جانتے یہ راستہ ان کا اختیار کردہ راستے سے بھی کہیں زیادہ خطرناک اور تباہ کن ہے۔حکمران اپنی دانست میںایک تیر سے دو شکار کرنا چاہتے ہیں سانپ بھی مرے اور لاٹھی بھی نہ ٹوٹے والی پالسی اختیار کرنا چاہتی ہے اسی پالسی کے تحت گلگت بلتستان کو دو حصوں میںکرنا چاہتی ہے۔ وفاقی حکمرانوں نے گلگت بلتستان کے اکثیریتی جماعتوں کی رائے کو جس میں گلگت بلتستان کو پاکستان کا آئینی صوبہ بنانے کا ذکر ہے حسب روایت مسترد کرتے ہوئے اپنی طرف سے ایک فارمولہ سامنے لایا ہے اس انوکھے ،اچھوتے اور متعصبا نہ فارمولے کے تحت گلگت بلتستان کو دو حصوں میں تقسیم کرناہے ۔ایک حصہ کو متنازعہ رہنے دینا اور ایک حصہ کو پاکستان کا حصہ بنانا ہے ۔ چلاس،گلگت،نگر ،ہنزہ اور غذرکو غیر متنازعہ اور استور ،روندو،سکردو ،شگر،خپلواور گانچھے کو متنازعہ رہنے دیناہے۔وفاقی حکمرانوں کو 69 سال کے بعد احساس ہونے لگا ہے کہ کشمیر پر استصواب رائے کے مقابلے میں پاک چین اقتصادی راہداری کہیں زیادہ اہمیت کی حامل ہے۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>وفاقی حکمرانوں کا معاملہ اس قوم کی طرح ہے جوحوادث کا مسلسل شکار رہنے اور غلطیوں پر غلطیاں کرنے کے بعد پشیمان ہوتی ہے اس لئے کسی شاعر نے کیا خوب کہا ہے\" ہائے اُس ذود پشیماں کا پشیماں ہونا \" گلگت بلتستان کے لوگوں کو اپنے علاقے کو پاکستان کا آئینی حصہ بنانے پر نہ صرف کوئی اعتراض نہ تھابلکہ یہ ان کا دیرانہ بلکہ شروع دن سے ہی مطالبہ رہا ہے کہ گلگت بلتستان کو پاکستان کا پانچواں صوبہ بنایا جائے۔ اب بھی گلگت بلتستان کے لوگوں کو صوبہ بنانے پر کوئی اعتراض نہیں مگر اس کے حصے بخرے کر کے ،دھڑوں میں بانٹ کر اور بد نیتی کے ساتھ نہیں بلکہ نیک نیتی کے ساتھ اور مکمل اکائی کی حیثیتمیںاور اگر کسی بد نیتی یا فرقہ وارانہ تعصب کے تحت ایسا کرنے کی غلطی یا کوشش کی گئی تو اس کی گلگت بلتستان کے لوگوں کی طرف سے ویسی ہی مذاحمت کی جائے گی جیسی مذاحمت ویت نام نے انگریزوں کے خلاف،فلسطین نے اسرائیل کے خلاف، آئر لینڈ نے برطانیہ کے خلاف، یمن نے سعودی عرب کے خلاف اور افغانستان نے امریکہ کے خلاف کی ہے اور کر رہے ہیں۔بادی النظر میں گلگت بلتستان کی تقسیم کی بات پاک چین اقتصادی راہداری کے تناظر میں کی جاتی ہے مگر اس کے پس ِ پردہ موجودہ وفاقی حکومت کے گلگت بلتستان کے لوگوں کے خلاف باا لعموم ایک مکتب فکر کے خلاف متعصبانہ بلکہ معاندانہ عزائم کارفرما نظر آتے ہیں۔ پاکستان کے متعصب حکمران ،سیاست دان، سرکاری آافیسروں ، دانشور اور دینی علماءگلگت بلتستان کے لوگوں سے اور خصوصاََ ایک فرقے سے ازلی دشمنی رکھتے ہیں۔ اور مستقبل میں اس علاقے میں میں فرقہ ورانہ کشید گی کو ہوا دینے کی کاوشوں میں کارفر ما نظر آتے ہیں موجودہ جی بی کی صوبائی حکومت کا گلگت بلتستان کو دو حصوں میں تقسیم کرنے کا منصوبہ بھی اسی سازش کی ایک کڑی ہے۔یہاں کے عوام کومستقبل میںان شازشوں کو بے نقاب کر کے ان کے خلاف ایک آہنی دیوار بن کر ڈٹ جانے کی ضرورت ہے۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>بشکریہ بروشال ٹائمز گلگت</p>\n\t\t</section>\n\t</body>\n"
