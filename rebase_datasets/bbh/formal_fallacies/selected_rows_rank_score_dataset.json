(3) Криспин, более изворотливый и неунывающий, нежели Леандр, исполнен решимости раздобыть денег и даже разбогатеть, для чего предлагает дерзкий план. (4) Леандр должен выдать себя за богатого и знатного человека, приехавшего в город по важному государственному делу, а об остальном под видом его слуги позаботится Криспин. (5) Леандру не очень по душе эта затея: его пугают возможные последствия подобного обмана, но он сдаётся перед настойчивостью приятеля, понимая, что положение у них безвыходное. (6) Друзья стучатся в дверь гостиницы и просят лучшие комнаты и обильный ужин. (7) Хозяин сначала относится к ним недоверчиво, но заносчивость Криспина и его напористость убеждают трактирщика, что перед ним важные господа. (8) Вскоре приходят Арлекин, местный поэт, и его Друг Капитан. (9) Не один раз они ели в долг в этой гостинице и надеются поужинать тут и сегодня. (10) Однако терпение трактирщика иссякло, и он отказывается их кормить. (11) Сметливый Криспин решает привлечь Арлекина и Капитана на свою сторону, делая вид, что ему известны блестящие стихи Арлекина и смелые подвиги Капитана. (12) Он тут же приказывает накормить Арлекина и Капитана ужином за счёт Леандра, и трактирщик не смеет отказать: он уже усвоил, что этим знатным господам ни в чём нельзя перечить.",

Initially I was indifferent (I think), but after hanging out for a while in the first month, I found myself thinking about her **ALOT**. Also found myself denying that I love her, but, maybe I really do?\n\nAnyway, we haven't really done much together, if at all. From what I remember, there's the excursion with other friends to some fun place (BOUNCEinc), and a dinner *\"date\"* (what makes something a date anyway?), but that's it. I do/did try to converse with her through IM, but it's never satisfying because she *always* stops responding without warning (I presume she's just busy whenever that happens, but maybe I'm fooling myself? I mean, the notifications are *right there*, wth?)\n\nFast forward a year later, to now, still wondering if I should tell her, and when. The doubt is mostly because we haven't interacted much and I feel it might make the situation.....awkward, but also because I suspect she's already in a relationship (not certain).\n\nRight now, I'm thinking of calling her up and offering my time to chat over some coffee or something; see how that goes.\n\nSo, what should I do?

Initially I was indifferent (I think), but after hanging out for a while in the first month, I found myself thinking about her **ALOT**. Also found myself denying that I love her, but, maybe I really do?\n\nAnyway, we haven't really done much together, if at all. From what I remember, there's the excursion with other friends to some fun place (BOUNCEinc), and a dinner *\"date\"* (what makes something a date anyway?), but that's it. I do/did try to converse with her through IM, but it's never satisfying because she *always* stops responding without warning (I presume she's just busy whenever that happens, but maybe I'm fooling myself? I mean, the notifications are *right there*, wth?)\n\nFast forward a year later, to now, still wondering if I should tell her, and when. The doubt is mostly because we haven't interacted much and I feel it might make the situation.....awkward, but also because I suspect she's already in a relationship (not certain).\n\nRight now, I'm thinking of calling her up and offering my time to chat over some coffee or something; see how that goes.\n\nSo, what should I do? Confess? Don't speak of it? Talk her into some night(s) out? Am I even playing the dating game (right)?\n\n##context\n\nTL;DR:",

        "explanation": "\"If you ever wondered about the evidence for those hot and/or smelly creams for arthritis pain, this column drove home a \"\"healthy skeptic\"\" perspective, emphasizing, for the most part, that \"\"there’s no good evidence that any over-the-counter rub or cream offers real relief for arthritis,\"\" according to one source. We say \"\"for the most part\"\" because it ended oddly, allowing some broad, vague, unsubstantiated and unquantified claims — \"\"seem to help some people…can give you temporary relief.\"\" We also wish the column had given a glimpse of the regulatory oversight that allows claims like \"\"deep penetrating pain relief\"\" or \"\"proven clinical effectiveness in treating arthritis pain\"\" when the column itself kept repeating:   \"\"no good evidence\"\"   \"\"results that do exist have been far from convincing\"\"   \"\"no better than placebo\"\"   \"\"relief was minor and didn’t show up until four weeks of treatment\"\"  \"\"the effect is usually either too fleeting or too mild to notice\"\"   \"\"there’s no known pathway they could take to ease arthritis pain.\"\"\"",

        "main_text": "\"The story listed the cost per unit for all three creams. The story didn’t provide the numbers from a cited 1994 study on capsaicin benefits. Overall, the message of \"\"no good evidence\"\" was clear. But, confusingly, the story gave the last word to a rheumatologist who said some of these creams \"\"do seem to help some people…it can give you temporary relief.\"\" If you’re going to do that, we think you need to provide numbers. How many people? How long is temporary? To end the story in this way – without numbers to back up this flip-flop of a message – was disappointing. The story was clear about lack of effectiveness overall – and that with the capsaicin cream, \"\"the burning sensation is often intolerable.\"\" The story went right to the point:  \"\"there’s no good evidence that any over-the-counter rub or cream offers real relief for arthritis, Altman says. Very few high-quality studies have ever investigated the products, he says, and the results that do exist have been far from convincing.\"\" There was no disease-mongering of the pain of arthritis. Two expert sources in rheumatology were interviewed. The story danced around the topic of a placebo effect without ever directly addressing it. And it didn’t make any direct comparison with aspirin or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or with heating pads or other options. The over-the-counter availability of the creams is clear in the story. The story offered this context:  \"\"Over the centuries, people have been willing to rub all sorts of things into their sore joints. Today, arthritis sufferers can choose from a wide range of over-the-counter creams with different approaches to relief.\"\" By the end of the story it was clear that today’s creams may not offer much advancement over what’s been done with rubs through the centuries.

        "date_published": "November 2, 2016",
        "explanation": "This viral news story is a good example of a poorly executed bait and switch. It provides results of an actual study to gain credibility before switching into unsubstantiated, unverifiable, and illogical claims, forcing a connection that — like “Dr. Olivia Bader-Lee” herself — will not appear, no matter how hard you look for it.",
        "fact_checkers": "Alex Kasprak",
        "main_text": "In August 2016, web site Simple Capacity posted a curious story (“Science Finally Confirms that People Absorb Energy from Others”) which subsequently went viral on a number of meditation or alternative health and science social media pages. The article is a reprint of something first written on 22 November 2012, and published on web site PreventDisease.com. That author’s main claim is well summarized by the first two sentences of the article: A biological research team at Bielefeld University has made a groundbreaking discovery showing that plants can draw an alternative source of energy from other plants. This finding could also have a major impact on the future of bioenergy eventually providing the evidence to show that people draw energy from others in much the same way. This article distorts the findings of an actual scientific study about a species of green algae called Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. That research, published in the journal Nature Communications on 20 November 2012, demonstrated that — in addition to photosynthesis — this species of green algae, under sub-optimal growing conditions, can derive energy by breaking down and consuming the cellulose (the main molecule of a green plant’s cell walls) of other nearby plants, too. As reported in a Universitaet Bielefeld press release: “This is the first time that such a behaviour has been confirmed in a vegetable organism,” says Professor Kruse. “That algae can digest cellulose contradicts every previous textbook. To a certain extent, what we are seeing is plants eating plants.” The paper also speculated that this technology could be used to convert cellulose waste (e.g. crops, paper, et cetera) into a form of carbon that could be used as a biofuel, a process that currently relies on a type of fungi that needs additional sources of energy to grow. The press release continued: If, in future, cellulose enzymes can be obtained from algae, there would be no more need for the organic material to feed the fungi. In the case of the Simple Capacity viral story, the major leap from the scientific study to pseudoscience occurred when “psychologist and energy healer” Dr. Olivia Bader-Lee (who may be a fictional character created for the purpose of promoting this one claim) commented on the study. The logic of the transition was not subtle: Flowers need water and light to grow and people are no different. Our physical bodies are like sponges, soaking up the environment. “This is exactly why there are certain people who feel uncomfortable in specific group settings where there is a mix of energy and emotions,” said psychologist and energy healer Dr. Olivia Bader-Lee. Bader-Lee’s claim is that this study of a specific species of algae reinforces a mystical notion that humans can sense and “feed” from one another’s energy: Bader-Lee suggests that the field of bioenergy is now ever evolving and that studies on the plant and animal world will soon translate and demonstrate what energy metaphysicians have known all along — that humans can heal each other simply through energy transfer just as plants do. “Human can absorb and heal through other humans, animals, and any part of nature. That’s why being around nature is often uplifting and energizing for so many people,” she concluded. If, however, humans did act like Chlamydomonas reinhardtii when they couldn’t create food for themselves, it would be a macabre undertaking. The algae literally consume the physical organic matter of other plants, not some unseen, untapped metaphysical form of energy. The analogous concept for humans would be cannibalism. To be consistent with the study, humans would also be required to be built of cellulose (which we are not), as the algae’s mechanism for deriving energy from other plants is to produce an enzyme that breaks down the cellulose and converts it into a form that can be consumed by its own cells.",

        "date_published": "March 1, 1996",
        "explanation": "Disney is, of course, well known for their image consciousness. They have been criticized in the past for policies such as not allowing marked emergency vehicles into their parks (so as not to upset park guests), and so many people perceive them as being willing and overzealous enough to stretch a semantic point for a minor public relations advantage.",
        "fact_checkers": "David Mikkelson",
        "main_text": "This legend is a tricky subject to tackle, because it’s based upon the fine (and often confusing) distinction between actual death and declared death. For example, if a seriously-injured victim of an automobile accident were loaded into a ambulance and died en route to the hospital, he generally would not be officially declared dead until he arrived at the hospital and was examined by a doctor. The difference in time between the actual physical death of the patient and the declaration of death by the doctor is the discrepancy on which this legend turns. So, the claim here is not that no one has ever actually died on Disney theme park property, but whether Disney can legitimately make the claim that “no one has ever died at a Disney park” because they ensure that any declaration of death takes place outside of park property. As such, there are really two questions which must be answered:   The first question is difficult to answer, because obviously Disney isn’t going to discuss such a sensitive issue. Some former Disney employees have reported that the “no one dies on Disney property” maxim is indeed a company policy; that, as suggested in the book Inside the Mouse, “if guests have the nerve to die, they wait, like unwanted calories, until they’ve crossed the line and can do so safely off the property”:  We had a guy last summer who went to EPCOT, stood in front of the golf ball, took a gun, and blew his head off. But he didn’t die. He stood right there in front of all those tourists and went “cluck” and brains blew everywhere. But he didn’t die there. The medic told me that they are not allowed to let them die there. Keep them alive by artificial means until they’re off Disney property, like there’s an imaginary line in the road and they go, “He’s alive, he’s alive, he’s dead.”  In all fairness, however, it should be noted that in some jurisdictions once paramedics begin life-saving efforts they cannot discontinue those efforts until the patient has been transported to a medical facility, even if the patient is obviously dead; therefore, what someone might interpret as “flogging a dead body” to delay a determination of death could actually be a legally required procedure. Moreover, the sprawling size and relative isolation of the Walt Disney World complex in Florida make it imperative that persons in need of urgent medical attention be loaded into helicopters and transported to hospitals as quickly as possible. The combination of these two factors makes it rather unlikely that anyone would actually be declared dead on Walt Disney World property, regardless of how The Walt Disney Company felt about the matter. Declared deaths on Disney property apparently have happened before, however, as reported by the New York Times in an article about a 1984 plane crash in the EPCOT parking lot:  A man was pronounced dead at the scene. A woman and a 2-year-old child died after being taken to a hospitals. The two survivors, a 3-year-old girl and a 5-year-old boy, were listed in critical condition at Orlando Regional Medical Center. In California as well, news accounts have mentioned instances where accident victims were declared dead while on Disneyland property, as in this 1985 Los Angeles Times report of a girl who was crushed to death under the wheels of a tour bus in the Disneyland parking lot:  The identity of the girl, who was pronounced dead at the scene, was not released pending notification of her parents, according to Sgt. Larry Kurtz. The driver of the bus was not held.",

        "claim": "The big question: Will cancer immune therapy work for me?.",
        "date_published": "",
        "explanation": "Dennis Lyon was a genetic train wreck. Cancer was ravaging his liver, lungs, bones and brain, and tests showed so many tumor mutations that drugs targeting one or two wouldn’t do much good. It seemed like very bad news, yet his doctors were encouraged.",
        "fact_checkers": " Marilynn Marchione",
        "main_text": "The reason: People with the most messed-up genes often are the ones who do best on treatments that enlist the immune system. “These are the patients we used to be very depressed about,” thinking they couldn’t be helped, said Dr. Razelle Kurzrock at the University of California, San Diego. “Now when we see those types of patients, we’re really excited,” because there are so many ways for the immune system to recognize the cancer cells as abnormal. Immunotherapy is the hottest thing in cancer care. Drugs called checkpoint inhibitors can vanquish some advanced cancers by removing a chemical cloak that hides them from the immune system. Former President Jimmy Carter got one at age 91 for skin cancer that spread to his brain, and now is in remission. But they’re expensive, have side effects, and work for only about one-quarter of patients — as few as 5 percent with colon cancer and as many as half with the skin cancer, melanoma. Sometimes the benefits are brief. Worst of all: For a small number of unlucky folks, treatment can backfire. Their cancer grows exponentially after getting a checkpoint drug. “We’re going to have to figure out not only who to treat with immunotherapy but who not to treat,” Kurzrock said. Gene tests are starting to help sort that out. But for patients, the big question is “Will it work for me?” PREDICTING WHO BENEFITS The first step is testing for a protein called PD-L1 that’s often involved in forming that chemical cloak. Some checkpoint drugs target this or a related protein, so people with a lot of it should respond to treatment. That was the hope when Diane Tippett showed up last October at Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center with a salivary gland cancer that had spread to her liver and lungs. “Five years ago, I probably would have thrown up my hands and given her standard chemo,” said the center’s director, Dr. Louis Weiner. Instead, he ordered tests that showed Tippett had a PD-L1 mutation, meaning her cancer made a lot of it. He started the 49-year-old Leonardtown, Maryland, woman on a checkpoint drug, Opdivo, and told her to come back in a few months. “Quite honestly, I didn’t know if I’d ever see her again,” he said. Now, Tippett’s lung tumors are gone. Her liver tumor shrank 50 percent and is stable. She got married in July and says she feels great. “I don’t feel any different than you do. I’m not tired, I’ve got all my hair,” she said. “I want more people to know about it and to ask their doctors about it,” she said of immunotherapy and the testing that led her to it. NOT THE WHOLE STORY That protein isn’t a very reliable predictor, though. Some people with a lot of it don’t benefit from the drugs and the opposite also is true. There are other checkpoints besides that one, too. Researchers increasingly are focusing on something else Tippett had: a high number of flawed genes. It’s a sign that tumors have been evolving over time and are hard to treat with drugs that target a single gene. It sometimes accompanies two other DNA problems that some checkpoint drugs already are approved to treat. Lyon, the San Diego man, had nearly two dozen different mutations after his skin cancer spread widely. In October 2015, he started on Opdivo and was in near-complete remission within two months. Recent tests showed no active cancer in his spine and lungs, and doctors think small spots in his brain and liver may be scar tissue, though they can’t know for sure. A test for tumor DNA in his blood found none. “It would appear my cancer is all dead,” he said, and called it “nothing short of miraculous” that gene tests led to successful treatment after years of trial and error. “I’m so grateful. No one’s lucky that gets cancer but I may be in an era where there’s a way through this tunnel.” Three-quarters of patients who are helped by checkpoint drugs have long-lasting benefits, as Lyon did, said Dr. Steven O’Day, an immunotherapy expert at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, California. “When you respond, it’s a home run in terms of long-term survival,” O’Day said. “But we still have to be better at predicting who those patients are.” THE DARK SIDE Others have not been so fortunate. In November, French researchers reported that 12 of 131 patients, or 9 percent, got much worse after checkpoint drugs, which seemed to speed their tumor growth. Kurzrock checked with colleagues and quickly found more cases — a 73-year-old man with bladder cancer, a 65-year-old woman with endometrial cancer, and a 44-year-old breast cancer patient whose tumors “just exploded” in size within two months of immunotherapy. In a report on 155 patients, she tied several gene mutations to this risk. Kurzrock has consulted for some gene-medicine makers and co-founded a company using a software program to determine best treatments for patients depending on their tumor genes. The unfortunate cases are a reality check, said Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society. “We are not paying close enough attention to those people” and need to know whether they fared badly because of their treatment or for other reasons, he said. SHOULD WE BE DOING ‘IMMUNOGRAMS’? That’s the question Dr. Eric Topol, director of the Scripps Translational Science Institute, posed a gene medicine conference he organized in March at the suburban San Diego research center. Should there be baseline tests to map what patients’ natural defenses look like? For example, how many immune system soldiers called T cells do they have in the area of the tumor? Max Krummel is working on a roadmap to do that. The University of California, San Francisco, scientist heads a project with $10 million from three companies that make checkpoint drugs. He is analyzing hundreds of tumor samples to see what immune system features spell success or failure. “We’re not looking at how the immune system changes,” but for what starting point works best with the drugs, he said. “What we’re seeing is that the kinds of cells you have in a tumor predict who’s going to respond.” Krummel, who was involved in work that led to Yervoy, the first checkpoint drug, has started a company to try to tune up one part of the immune system he thinks is key to maintaining a healthy balance. Cancer exists because the immune system isn’t working as it should, he said, so successful immunotherapy may require “treating the immune system, not treating the tumor.” ___ Marilynn Marchione can be followed on Twitter: @MMarchioneAP ___ This Associated Press series was produced in partnership with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

However, These episodes keep on coming back, like once a quarter kinds. This is changing me as a person and I don't appreciate this change in myself. They are making me negative and bitter. I don't match his definition of compatibility, so we decided to end this relationship. \n\nNow, I had left my job and moved to US with him on a dependent visa (since 2 years). I had used up all my savings on the wedding as at that time, my husband was a student and couldn't have afforded to share the costs. So, now I am broke, my marriage is over, I am still on a dependent visa here, and I don't want to go back home to my parents paying for me. \n\nMy parents love my husband, I never discussed any of the negative things about him so they think of him like some godsend husband for their daughter.

After many failed attempts of getting another dude to move in (tenant looking, and deciding not to take it), he is now considering having a woman move in close who is close to our age.   He is considering this before other options of lowering the rent, or using other sources besides Craigslist.\n\nI am uncomfortable because we had a talk before he made this decision that this would make me uncomfortable, and he agreed he'd feel the same way if the roles were reversed.\n\nNow that he's feeling the pressure, he is having a woman look at the place tonight. I expressed how uncomfortable I am with this because they will have a shared space, and I do not live there... and he is still doing it, regardless of the promise he made me in the beginning and fully knowing how uncomfortable I am.\n\nHe even said that if I moved in with guys he would not be ok with this.

        "claim": "Neurofeedback Gains Popularity and Lab Attention",
        "date_published": "October 5, 2010",
        "explanation": "\"This is a story about a purported surge in the popularity of neurofeedback to treat a host of neurological ills, despite a chronic lack of large, well-controlled trials to provide reliable evidence about benefits and harms. The existence of a single, small trial sponsored by the NIH (involving a mere 36 children with ADHD) hardly demonstrates that the treatment is \"\"gaining attention from mainstream researchers.\"\" The story could have done a better job of highlighting that support for this treatment comes primarily from those with a financial interest in its popularity. This story did provide information suggesting that neurofeedback is not an effective treatment. It erred in spending too much time suggesting that it might be of benefit when there is a complete absence of data to support such claims. While the headline of this story is slanted, on the plus side, it includes comments from many experts with a variety of perspectives. This story matters because it lends credence to a treatment modality in the absence of documentation.\"",
        "fact_checkers": " ",
        "main_text": "\"The story provided cost estimates for a couple of neurofeedback treatment regimens. It also indicated euphemistically that it is not paid for by insurance companies. Although the story points out that there has not been enough study of neurofeedback to know whether claims of benefits are justified, it highlights an anecdote of a family who believes the treatment helped their child. Without any countervailing examples, this sort of personal story overwhelms the dry statements of doubt, leaving an unbalanced impression. In considering this criterion, perhaps the most troubling aspect of the story is that it jumps from one condition to the other. Is the treatment good for autism, ADHD and other attention issues, cognition in old age? It’s a red flag when proponents of a treatment claim, in essence, that it’s good for whatever ails you. We will give the story the benefit of the doubt on this criterion because it did at least mentions that there are potential harms, but the story would have been better if it had given more detail about the type and frequency of harms. It should have also clearly noted that risks exist even when a treatment is supervised by a skilled practitioner.One of the potential harms raised is this uNPRoven treatment may be favored over proven options like behavioral therapy and medication. The story mentioned readily available neurofeedback packages while at the same time had stern warning from a society spokesperson that people can have seizures or anxiety attacks if they use equipment that they get from ebay and use without supervision. No information about how commonly problems such as these occur. In trying to give readers an overview of the available evidence on neurofeedback, the story fails to give readers enough information to judge the quality of the research. Most of the references to studies fail to note whether they were randomized controlled trials or something less rigorous. Although the story includes sharp comments from experts who note the paucity of evidence on neurofeedback treatments for serious conditions, it blunders by allowing a researcher to claim prematurely that participants in his trial are showing improvement, even though the results have yet to be released or reviewed by others. It also seems odd that the story portrays the National Institute of Mental Health as a \"\"former skeptic\"\" of neurofeedback, simply because the institute is sponsoring a trial. Studying something is not the same as supporting it, after all, isn’t putting something to the test exactly what a skeptic does? The story did not engage in overt disease mongering. The story included quotes from advocates as well as skeptics about benefit to be obtained through neurofeedback treatment. Although the story includes one comment refering to proven treatments, readers are short-changed by the lack of detail or any discussion of the weight of evidence backing alternatives as comapred to the vague and scarcely studied claims of benefit from neurofeedback. The story mentioned that there are 7,500 mental health professionals that offer neurofeedback services. The story seemed to provide a nice history of neurofeedback devices from the 1960’s. The story does not appear to be based on a news release.\"",

        "date_published": "October 3, 2012",
        "explanation": "As owner of 5 percent of the Los Angeles Lakers, Patrick Soon-Shiong could walk into the locker room of the storied basketball franchise any time for a chat with stars like Kobe Bryant. But the richest man in Los Angeles chooses to sit with the rest of his team’s fans.",
        "fact_checkers": "Ronald Grover",
        "main_text": "“He’s not one of those owners who wants to be seen everywhere. He’s just one of the fans,” said Bryant. The NBA star gives his owner a hug before every game for luck “and maybe some of the success” of the slender Los Angles surgeon who built a fortune exceeding $7 billion as a biotechnology entrepreneur. For all Soon-Shiong’s success, the South African emigre and son of a Chinese herbal doctor remains relatively unknown in Los Angeles, a city that thrives on status and celebrity. That’s likely to change soon. In recent weeks, he emerged as a likely bidder for fellow billionaire Philip Anschutz’s sports and entertainment unit AEG, owner of 100 venues worldwide and sports teams like the Los Angeles Kings hockey franchise and the L.A. Galaxy soccer team, not to mention a 20 percent stake in the Lakers. And on Wednesday in Washington DC, Soon-Shiong and his L.A.-based NantHealth will unveil a joint venture with Verizon, Intel, Blue Shield of California and others to create a nationwide system for doctors to share DNA and other data on cancer patients. It will enable doctors to do genetic analysis of a patient’s tumor in less than a minute — a job that now can take from eight to 10 weeks. “This is something the federal government should have done, but we waited and waited for them,” Soon-Shiong told Reuters in an interview. “It’s unconscionable that cancer patients get the wrong diagnosis 30 percent of the time and that it takes so long to treat them with appropriate drugs for their cancer.”  Soon-Shiong emigrated to the United States more than three decades ago with his wife Michele Chan, an actress who had a starring role in 80’s show “Danger Bay” that aired on CBS and the Disney Channel and guest roles on “ MacGyver.” Since then, he has methodically climbed the ladder of success by adroitly mixing science and business. He created drugs to fight diabetes and breast cancer and then sold the companies that produced them for a combined $8.6 billion. In the four years since selling those companies, he quietly spent more than $400 million of his own money to build a national fiber optic network that would link cancer clinics throughout the country — the groundwork for the health superhighway. Soon-Shiong’s philanthropy was in evidence at his West Los Angeles office. The new superhighway was illustrated on a flow chart in a conference room where staffers edited a video of it on a nearby TV set. In the lobby was a model of the campus surrounding the Saint John’s Health Center, to which he has given $135 million to build a biotech research center and sports medicine clinic. “There are few Patrick Soon-Shiongs in this world,” said retired General Wesley Clark, who has served with him on non-profit boards. “A brilliant doctor, a great businessman and someone who is very patriotic. He understands what it means to give back to his country.”  Elsewhere, Los Angeles bears the mark of Soon-Shiong’s largesse and his fixation on healthcare. He and his wife operate the Chan Soon-Shiong Family Foundation, which last year endowed a chair at the University of Southern California Viterbi School of Engineering to support research in engineering and medicine. In 2009, after watching TV footage of a woman dying on the emergency room floor because doctors didn’t notice her, he guaranteed $100 million to underwrite efforts to reopen Martin Luther King Hospital. The hospital, which has since reopened, serves the city’s low-income population. The coming months may mark the public convergence of his private passions: health, sports, philanthropy and his adopted city. He wants to buy AEG in large part because he plans to build a $1.2 billion football stadium to return pro football to the nation’s second largest city. Owning a National Football League team, he said, would give him a platform to promote wellness by having players mentor younger fans on exercise and healthy eating, and sharing training and medical techniques with local doctors. Until recently, Soon-Shiong kept a low profile. He and his wife did not want their name in a press release when they first donated $23 million to Saint John’s in 2007 to build a biomedical facility, recalled medical center president Lou Lazatin. “Finally, they agreed when I told them it would help my marketing,” Lazatin said. Soon-Shiong’s business career started in the early 1980s with the help of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which gave him $2 million for stem cell research that could one day help treat injuries during space travel. At the time, he was a surgeon at a hospital affiliated with the University of California, Los Angeles. With the money, he opened a small lab near a veteran’s hospital, where he developed treatments to reduce diabetes in pancreatic transplant patients and a cancer-fighting drug that doubled the response rate for the treatment of breast cancer. His climb was not without bumps. In 1999, his brother Terrence filed a complex suit claiming Patrick Soon-Shiong neglected work on a diabetes drug being developed by a startup in which Terrence had invested. But an arbitrator found in Patrick Soon-Shiong’s favor, and he declined to answer questions about the matter. By 2008, Patrick Soon-Shiong controlled 82 percent of APP Pharmaceuticals, the company he started to develop injectable drugs to treat cancer and other illnesses. Soon-Shiong sold the company for $5.6 billion to Germany’s Fresenuis Kabi Pharmaceuticals, netting him $4.6 billion. In 2010, he sold Abraxis BioScience, which he had spun off from APP in 2007, to pharmaceutical company Celgene Corp. for $2.9 billion. His 82 percent stake was worth $2.4 billion. Soon-Shiong paid Celgene $135 million for NantWorks, where he had begun the work of creating his planned high-tech health delivery network. He contacted potential partners for the venture, including meeting AEG owner Anschutz, with whom he spent a day in the Denver suburb of Aurora touring the Anshutz Medical Campus. Soon-Shiong also bought or provided seed money to small technology companies to aid in that effort. He paid $20 million to buy a controlling interest in KeyOn Communications, which provides wireless broadband service for rural markets, and another $10 million to a stake in Raptor Networks Technology, which makes switching equipment for high speed networks. “He watches every detail. I get emails from him at 2:30 in the morning, said Stephen Berman, CEO of toy maker JAAKS Pacific, which is licensing technology from one of Soon-Shiong’s companies to make interactive toys. He gives more than just money, says songwriter Burt Bacharach, whose son went to private school with Soon-Shiong’s daughter. Soon-Shiong showed up unannounced at Cedars Sinai Hospital one day, says Bacharach, to help doctors find the right combination of drugs to treat the musician’s son, who had a persistent staph infection. For L.A.’s richest man, that patient visit was a brief return to the role of physician that he insists he one day will resume.",

Notwithstanding, this guy is incredibly down-to-earth and we ended up getting along really well, as if we've been old friends.

Nothing physical happened during the trip, though.\n\nFast forward to today, when we're both back to our respective cities, we're still exchanging e-mails: what's happening in our lives lately, photos, jokes, etc. I like him for sure, but I'm not entirely certain if he likes me back or if he's just being friendly.\n\nApart from the he-likes-me-he-likes-me-not guessing game, I'm also brooding about how John is in the position of giving me the opportunity of joining his firm. That'll be huge for me. The thing is, I'm not shabby looking. It's very easy for male clients and other people I work with to fall for me.

        "explanation": "\"This condition for the vast majority of people is a minor cosmetic annoyance that in no way affects their health, but the article suggests that everyone is potentially a candidate for expensive removal procedures based on trumped-up discussion of health risks. And while the story provides a fair amount of useful information about these treatments, it unjustifiably extols the benefits of newer treatments without comparing them to existing surgical techniques. It also relies too much on anecdote and didn’t seek out a perspective from someone with no financial interest in these procedures. Overall, a pretty poor showing from the Times. We expect and need better from the nation’s premier daily. An industry has arisen to treat varicose veins, with dermatologists, vascular surgeons, radiologists, and other \"\"specialists\"\" all cashing in. It is shameful that our failing health care system cannot distinguish what is a cosmetic procedure the majority of the time from the very occasional patient who requires medical treatment for varicosities.\"",
        "fact_checkers": " ",
        "main_text": "\"No discussion of costs — a big hole when we’re talking about treatments that are highly profitable for specialists and are often sought out for cosmetic reasons and not because of any health risk. The benefits discussed in this story were ALL anecdotal. In addition, the story reports on a newly approved pharmaceutical intervention without citing any success rates, absolute or relative. Not satisfactory. The story doesn’t get specific as to how often harms should be expected with the various treatments discussed, but it does mention some of the more common problems that can occur, including recurrence of the varicose vein or the creation of new varicose veins in the same area. Still, the story goes to significant lengths to make readers think this is a benign procedure (including a quote about one patient feeling a \"\"a little tiny pinch\"\"), when long-term consequences of superficial vein ablation on risks of deep vein issues such as clots are unknown. Overall, because the story didn’t give any sense of the scope of the problems – how often someone considering the various approaches may experience harms if they do – we must rule this unsatisfactory. The story doesn’t spend much time discussing the complexities of the medical evidence, but in its defense, it does make sure to provide specifics regarding which treatments are FDA-approved and which are being used off-label. This is in and of itself a key indicator of the strength of the data supporting different treatments. Still, the story goes a bit off course when it compares the effectiveness of different treatments without citing any data. It quotes an expert who says that newer, more expensive radio-frequency and laser treatments are \"\"a heck of a lot better than surgery” for treatment of underlying varicose veins. But we would expect such an assessment from someone who developed a laser treatment for varicose veins, as this expert apparently did. What would be more compelling is some reference to studies showing that these new treatments improve outcomes compared with conventional surgery–but no such information was provided. In fact, recent reviews suggest that while these newer treatments may work as well as surgery in the short term, current studies haven’t followed patients long enough to determine which is more effective over the long term. The story claims that doctors believe everyone with varicose veins should seek out medical care. Excerpt: Really? How many doctors? Who are these doctors? Are they doctors who stand to gain from treating this condition? This is a terribly misleading generalization. While it is true that a minority of patients are at risk of more serious medical problems related to their varicose veins, the vast majority of people have nothing to fear and don’t need to see a doctor. The article should have emphasized the benign nature of most varicose veins and identified the uncommon circumstances under which people should seek out medical attention for potential health risks. Although the story gets high marks for tapping a number of expert sources, it should have done more to identify potential conflicts of interest. One expert who supports laser surgery is appropriately identified as the developer of a laser technique, but Dr. Robert Weiss, another expert quoted in the story, is identified only as the director of the Maryland Laser, Skin and Vein Institute. If fails to mention that he is also a consultant to Medicis Pharmaceuticals, which manufactures Asclera, a drug recently approved by the FDA which is discussed in the story. To avoid the appearance of any bias, the story should have disclosed this relationship. It also should have tried to get a comment from someone who doesn’t benefit financially from these procedures. The story discusses surgery for varicose veins in the past tense, suggesting that it is no longer used. (\"\"It entailed ripping out the groin-to-ankle vein with a wire via an incision.\"\") In fact, as discussed above, the supposed long-term superiority of newer techniques over surgery has not yet been proven, and surgery still has a place in the treatment of certain types of varicose veins, especially larger veins. The story also failed to mention lifestyle changes, such as weight loss or avoiding standing or sitting for long periods, which are typically the first line treatment for this condition. As the story was in the fashion section, they should have also mentioned makeup, hosiery, etc, in addition to therapeutic interventions that a doctor might recommend. The story provides very specific information as to the availability of different treatments for varicose veins in the U.S. The story doesn’t suggest that any of these treatments are more novel than is actually the case. It’s clear that this story isn’t based on a news release.\"",

I go to university  in Montreal and she just recently transferred to a college upstate NY so we get to see each other much more now. The first semester of college was tough not getting to see her. But we managed to get through it, and we're both really happy now that we can see each other more.\n\nThe problem:\nI spent the past weekend over at her residence and we had an amazing time. I love getting to sleep next to her and to see her and to talk to her in person.\n\nFor about a week or so now though she has been talking about Valentines day and how stupid she thinks it is. She kept saying it's such a cop out and how she thought it was wrong that people need a day to pretend that they like each other more than they really do. I don't know what I'm doing... she's my first valentine ever and so I thought it might be good if I didn't get her anything because of the way she felt about the holiday.\n\nLast night as I left she ran back to her room and gave me a Valentines day card. I was touched, but I felt really bad for not having anything to give her too. I felt horrible and I apologized , but she just said that it was ok in a monotone voice... and then my taxi pulled up. I tried to make sure she was ok, I didn't want to leave her hurt. She convinced me that she was fine and I finally got into the taxi. On the bus back home she texted me saying that she was actually upset about what I did. I tried to apologize more but I think it just made things worse.\n\nIt's actually Valentines day today, and I could get a bus and do something special for her still, but I don't really know what to do. Should I just give her space? I just want her to know that I love her and that she is special to me.",

        "explanation": "\"Maybe the disconnect between journalist and reader is best (worst) seen in this line from the story:  \"\"The group of statins that showed the greatest effect in reducing risk are classified as lipophilic.\"\" All statins are lipophilic. And the story gave readers no definition, no explanation of what lipophilic even means. So it’s like a high school term paper where the student slips in big words to impress the teacher. Readers should not be impressed. Over and over again we see the same flaws in health care journalism stories. These are not just academic issues. These flaws expose stories that simply fail to communicate vital information to readers.\"",
        "fact_checkers": " ",
        "main_text": "\"Even though both brand name and generic versions of statin medication are available, there was no information about costs in this story. Why this is so – in a story that suggests a possible future expanded market for these already widely-used drugs, is a puzzle. The story reported the more impressive-sounding relative risk reduction (i.e. \"\"The analysis shows there was a 12% reduction of colorectal cancer risk among statin users.\"\") rather than indicating absolute risk reduction. This is such an important issue – so often misunderstood – that we offer a little primer on the topic. Just as bothersome, the story really whiffed on the opportunity to explain the limitations of observational studies, and in so doing, it may have confused many readers. The headline says \"\"may cut risk.\"\" But the first line says both \"\"significant association\"\" and \"\"reduced risk.\"\" Wait a minute! Which is it? An association? Or an established cause-and-effect piece of evidence? Readers should have been told that observational studies CAN’T establish cause and effect. So the story is wrong to use language like \"\"may cut risk\"\" or \"\"reduced risk\"\" in the headline and in the first sentence.\"",

        "explanation": "\"No one disputes that Kenyon was on duty for 96 straight hours, Kenyon had some opportunity for sleep and it’s likely he did. But he doesn’t remember when that was, or for how long. He only recalls sleeping during the last 7 of the 96 hours The question that Doughty Tweeted: \"\"@Jorge_Elorza still think your plan is safe?\"\" was fair to ask, even if the public was not at risk as both Pare and the captain assert. (Further, Pare disputes Doughty’s charge that the plan is a \"\"disaster!!!\"\") But without clarification, Doughty’s suggestion that Kenyon \"\"worked 96 hours straight\"\" could leave the impression that Kenyon never slept. He did sleep. To be more accurate, Doughty could have said that Kenyon had been \"\"on duty\"\" for 96 hours. The job, by its nature,  involves a mixture of sleep and work.\"",
        "fact_checkers": "Mark Reynolds",
        "main_text": "\"In early November, a Providence fire captain, Zachariah Kenyon, clocked 96 hours in a row — the equivalent of two 48-hour work weeks. The 45-year-old’s marathon tour of duty follows much argument over the restructuring of the firefighters’ shift schedule, ordered in August by Mayor Jorge O. Elorza. Instead of working 42 hours per week in four shifts firefighters are now working in three shifts of 48 hours every six days, or an average of 56 hours per week. One vocal critic of the change, Paul A. Doughty, president of the firefighters’ union, went on Twitter to address the mayor: \"\"...still think your plan is safe? Rescue Captain Kenyon just worked 96 hours straight. 96 hours. Your plan is a disaster!!!\"\" So a firefighter worked 96 hours straight? We wondered if that really happened. And if so, how? We reached out to Public Safety Commissioner Steven M. Pare, Doughty and Kenyon, who also has a leadership position in the union, serving on its board and representing about 80 fire employees in special services divisions. Of course, we were interested in Kenyon’s story, but initially we just wanted to see the records. Kenyon gave us a personnel record that shows he reported to duty on the morning of Friday, Nov. 6, around 8 a.m. and he remained on duty for a 96-hour period that ended Tuesday, Nov. 10, around 8 a.m. The personnel record also shows that Kenyon had originally been scheduled to work two 10-hour shifts, one on Friday and another on Saturday followed by two 14-hour overnight shifts on Sunday into Monday and Monday into Tuesday. This adds up to 48 hours on duty over 5 days. Kenyon ended up on duty for each of the four scheduled shifts plus all hours in between, according to the record. The captain accepted one overtime shift and he was ordered to stand duty for the other three shifts. This is how he explained how he came to be on duty for 96 hours and Pare confirmed it. Ninety-six hours seems like a very long time for someone with public safety responsibilities to be on the clock. For Doughty and other firefighters, \"\"working\"\" and being on duty are the same thing. However, Providence firefighters, unlike police officers, can often climb into bed between emergencies during their shifts. So Kenyon was not on his feet like a construction worker or an emergency room nurse for 96 straight hours. It’s also clear that he got paid for 96 hours of work. Without knowing how much Kenyon slept, it seemed reasonable for Doughty to ask the mayor if this was safe. Pare asserts that the captain had ample opportunity to get the rest necessary to perform effectively in emergency situations and Kenyon could have asked to go home if he felt he hadn’t had enough sleep to operate safely. Kenyon, who doesn’t remember how much sleep he had during the 96 hours, says he was able to operate safely. \"\"I feel I’m pretty capable,\"\" he says. Doughty disagrees, suggesting that sleep deprivation erodes a person’s ability to make good judgments about his or her capabilities. It’s against department policy for firefighters to sleep past 7 a.m., he says, and the noise at fire headquarters, with alarms sounding, is another issue. \"\"It’s not good sleep,\"\" Doughty says. \"\"It’s not rehabilitative sleep.\"\" We looked at public safety records, including dispatch logs, and found that Kenyon and those who also worked on Rescue 4 handled 67 emergency calls over the course of 96 hours. The crew transported 43 patients to hospitals and 15 calls were cancelled en route, according to the records we reviewed, which are not clear on what happened with the other nine calls. Kenyon, who says he doesn’t need as much sleep as others,  recalls sleeping the last seven hours of his 96-hours on duty, but he says he doesn’t remember when he slept during the first 89 hours. Records that Pare provided to PolitiFact indicate there were several other periods within that 89-hour span when Kenyon was not busy with calls and had some opportunity for sleep. The records show three periods of about four hours during the morning hours of Saturday, Nov. 7, Sunday Nov. 8, and Monday Nov. 9. Our ruling No one disputes that Kenyon was on duty for 96 straight hours, Kenyon had some opportunity for sleep and it’s likely he did. But he doesn’t remember when that was, or for how long. He only recalls sleeping during the last 7 of the 96 hours The question that Doughty Tweeted: \"\"@Jorge_Elorza still think your plan is safe?\"\" was fair to ask, even if the public was not at risk as both Pare and the captain assert. (Further, Pare disputes Doughty’s charge that the plan is a \"\"disaster!!!\"\") But without clarification, Doughty’s suggestion that Kenyon \"\"worked 96 hours straight\"\" could leave the impression that Kenyon never slept. He did sleep. To be more accurate, Doughty could have said that Kenyon had been \"\"on duty\"\" for 96 hours. The job, by its nature,  involves a mixture of sleep and work.\"",

        "explanation": "\"The one thing we didn’t like in the story was letting the independent urologist get away with his claim that the findings were \"\"clinically significant.\"\" We liked the way one observer put it in an online comment posted after the WSJ online story:   \"\"I had to chuckle when reading about the \"\"clinically significant\"\" 5.5-fold increase. Although the men rated their experience significantly higher on measures of control and satisfaction, was this 5.5 increase from about 56 seconds to 3 mins.18 seconds sufficient to make their experience as a couple more meaningful and rewarding? Did the partners rate their experiences as improved? I would characterize this finding as \"\"less than perfect\"\" just as the urologist quoted referred to the alternative treatments. Perhaps the study can be improved by combining spray plus sex therapy for one experimental group, spray treatment alone for another group, and sex therapy alone for the third group. I also think that giving the couples a stop watch injects an artificial component that is likely to have its own sent of negative ramifications.\"\" Sexual dysfunctions can be serious and life altering, and there is a steady parade of therapies being offered both through the standard scientific process and through outright hucksterism. It is important for reporters not to be blinded by the glare of sex therapy and to focus on the details the way they would with any other drug or treatment.\"",
        "fact_checkers": " ",
        "main_text": "\"The company behind the product undoubtedly has done market research about how much of this product it might sell and at what price. At a minimum, that information should have been included here. It presents the benefits in both relative and absolute terms in the second paragraph of the story. It would be nice to have a NNT or number needed to treat in here. It also would be nice to see the range of performance after using the drug. Did some of the men on placebo have gains in ejaculation time that were unusually high? Did some on the drug have no gain or even a loss of time? It’s also not clear how the researchers knew what the \"\"no drug\"\" ejaculation time was, how they were chosen for the research or whether they fell into a particular age bracket. The story did a \"\"satisfactory\"\" job quantifying the benefits, not a perfect job. And in an imperfect world of health stories, this part of the story was actually above average. It talks about the potential side effects, but it limits that discussion to what the study found in a very small group of men. Are there long term effects from lidocaine exposure that have been found in other studies? Does the body build up resistance to lidocaine? This isn’t a short term problem that can be solved with a few weeks of therapy. It is usually a life long problem, and the story should be framed that way both in discussing the benefits and the harms. By using an outside expert to say in the third graph that the findings are \"\"clinically significant,\"\" the story makes it sound as if the case for this drug has already been made. Perhaps Tom Lue gave some context around this comment, but that context is not included. Instead, we are told that patients will be \"\"much happier.\"\" If you have this problem, you are looking up the company’s website to get on their mailing list. But both groups experienced a gain in ejaculation time. Why would that be? And, given that these sexual encounters were self timed, how confident can we be in the results? Another thing that the story never addresses is the idea of optimal time for sex. It also treats this particular sexual dysfunction as a purely single male problem instead of a larger issue of an unsatisfying sexual relationship between a man and his partner. The drug was tested with two people having sex, but the person who did not receive the spray is never taken into account. The men \"\"rated their sexual experiences significantly higher\"\" than those who got placebos. The only reference to the partners is literally the second to the last sentence, \"\"Also, 0.6% of the men’s female partners reported at least some loss of sensation.\"\" We don’t hear anything about the limitations of the study design. It appears to be a quasi-synthesis of 2 clinical trials. There isn’t any caution about the limited or nonexistent peer-review which takes place for an \"\"abstract\"\" at a meeting. Regarding study design, all we know is that researchers took 2 previous trials already made public (would have been helpful to include what the primary findings were) and \"\"combined them with added new data.\"\" This study design is highly suspect. We do not know anything about whether the 2 trials were similar enough to combine, and in what manner they were combined. The section describing premature ejaculation does a better than average job attempting to define the scope of the problem while describing the limitations of the research that has been done in this area. One line could be a model for other journalists to learn from: \"\"Surveys have suggested that as many as 20% to 30% of men may suffer from premature ejaculation, though these figures are often drawn from broadly worded survey questions and may overstate the number of men with significant problems.\"\" The reporter clearly read a lot about the problem and the potential treatments and does a fairly good job synthesizing this information. The story makes it clear that the two outside sources were not involved in this research. It is unclear whether these doctors are involved in any competing research or research into a similar product. There are three full graphs in a 12 graph story about the standard treatments and off-label treatments. I felt like I knew more about the state of premature ejaculation medicine after reading this story than I did about the actual success of these two trials. The story makes it clear, even in the headline, that these are the results of a trial and that there currently is no product even in the FDA pipeline. It also talks about a drug therapy from Johnson & Johnson and where it is being sold. It says at one point in the story that the \"\"findings of both trials had previously been made public.\"\" It would have been nice to know where, how and why. Presumably at previous conferences, and, if so, why is this treatment not already in the FDA pipeline. Reporters should always be wary of scientists, especially corporate ones, who are using the trade show circuit to build momentum for their product instead of following a rigorous peer review process. This story really is all about the novelty, and it does a good job of exploring some of the other treatments available. Clearly, there is no published study. The company involved in the drug did issue this press release (http://www.renalandurologynews.com/novel-treatment-for-premature-ejaculation-shows-promising-results/article/171435/)There are some differences between the numbers used in the story and the numbers in the press release, but it’s not clear how much of this is because of different caveats. (The number of men who actually completed the study, for example, versus all of those who were involved.) The story goes well beyond the release and was finished before the press conference at the AUA meeting.\"",

        "main_text": "\"Electronic cigarettes are devices designed to mimic cigarettes without burning tobacco. Instead, a liquid is rapidly heated, turning it into a gas that users inhale. Often the liquid contains nicotine, the highly addictive substance that keeps smokers hooked. Many smokers say e-cigs have allowed them to stay away from conventional cigarettes and avoid the cancer-causing chemicals they generate. Whether e-cigs should be regulated and banned from public areas the way most tobacco products are, has become contentious here and across the country. The health risks posed to users of e-cigarettes and the people nearby remain uncertain. Some products give off visible smoke, while others don't. Some of the liquids vaporized by the devices contain pleasant flavors, sparking fear that non-cigarette smokers -- particularly teens -- will embrace them and become addicted to nicotine. Complicating the debate: some liquids don't contain any nicotine at all, which avoids the health risk that nicotine is known to pose. Against this backdrop, the Rhode Island Senate Committee on Health & Human Services held a hearing April 16, 2015, on two proposals. The first, S-482, would require vendors to post the same warning signs that go with conventional tobacco products when they sell e-cigarettes. The second, S-489, \"\"prohibits the use of electronic nicotine delivery system products in public places and places of employment,\"\" just as smoking is prohibited. One person to testify against both bills was Dino Baccari, whose North Providence company, White Horse Vapor, makes and sells e-cigarettes. Baccari contended that even though conventional cigarettes and most e-cigs contain nicotine, \"\"vaping\"\" on an e-cigarette is not as addictive. He said he had the evidence to prove it. \"\"Penn State University, Dec. 17 of 2014, found that electronic cigarettes … are far less addictive than cigarettes,\"\" he told the committee. Because nicotine is the driving force in tobacco addiction, and nicotine content in vaping products varies widely, we wondered if Baccari's assessment of the research was correct. He sent us a link to the Penn State website where a Dec. 9, 2014, news release declared: \"\"E-cigarettes less addictive than cigarettes.\"\" The chief author of the study, published in the respected journal Nicotine & Tobacco Research, was Jonathan Foulds, professor of public health sciences and psychiatry at Penn State's College of Medicine. He told us that former smokers who now use electronic cigarettes indicated that e-cigarettes were far less addicting. The conclusion was based on an online survey with 158 questions, some of which were designed to assess things such as withdrawal, craving and frequency of use. Just over 3,600 e-cigarette users responded. Here are some of the findings in which the e-cigs users were asked comparable questions about their smoking and vaping: * While 86 percent reported \"\"strong,\"\" \"\"very strong\"\" or \"\"extremely strong\"\" urges to smoke a cigarette, the rate was just 12 percent with e-cigarettes. * While 41 percent said their cravings were so strong they had woken up at night to smoke cigarettes, only 7 percent of e-cigarette users said they had done that. * While 92 percent said they were more irritable when they were unable to smoke their cigarettes, only 26 percent reported that type of irritability when they can't use their e-cigarette. * \"\"Over 90 percent reported that they had experienced strong urges to smoke and withdrawal symptoms when a smoker, but only 25 to 35 percent reported experiencing these symptoms of dependence as an e-cig user.\"\" Foulds said it's likely that e-cigarettes are less addictive because they are not as efficient at getting nicotine into the body as cigarettes. \"\"They deliver less nicotine and less quickly,\"\" Foulds said. The highest dependence levels were seen among e-cigarette users whose liquids contained the highest levels of nicotine and among users of newer e-cigarette products that deliver more nicotine to the body faster. But even those customers reported that they felt less addicted than when they smoked tobacco. Such research is not without its potential problems, as Foulds acknowledged. People may not accurately recall their cravings from their days as cigarette smokers. Also, it was an online survey that anyone could take, although the team tried to flag people who might have a financial interest in promoting e-cigarettes. \"\"Maybe in five years, these people will be just as addicted to their e-cigarettes,\"\" Foulds said. \"\"But based on the data that we have in this study, we got a significantly lower dependence score\"\" than for conventional cigarettes. A spokeswoman for the American Lung Association said the study appears to be \"\"legitimate, thorough and balanced.\"\" We also found a second study, published Feb. 1, 2015, in the journal Drug and Alcohol Dependence, led by Jean-Francois Etter of the University of Geneva, which reached a similar conclusion based on survey data. Said the authors, \"\"We found that e-cigarettes users were less addicted to e-cigarettes than smokers were addicted to tobacco cigarettes.\"\" A third survey-based study from 2013, published in the journal Drug and Alcohol Review, found the same thing. Our ruling Dino Baccari said that a Penn State University study found that \"\"electronic cigarettes … are far less addictive than cigarettes.\"\" He's not blowin' smoke. His characterization of the study's conclusion is accurate. But it's important to note that the conclusion is based on an open-to-anyone survey that relied on the recall of e-cigarette users who may have a natural bias toward reporting that the products they've chosen to use are less addicting than the cigarettes they're trying to avoid.

        "claim": "Rolfing brings woman relief from disorder",
        "date_published": "July 15, 2008",
        "explanation": "\"This was a very flawed story about the use of rolfing – a form of massage therapy – in two patients – one with tardive dyskinesia-dystonia and the other with nerve damage after back surgery. The piece was built mainly on anecdote, with several major shortcomings. Most notably, there was no description of how rolfing is actually done, no evidence to support its use, and no discussion of quantifiable benefit or harm. There was also no unbiased, independent expert interviewed. A rolfing practitioner is interviewed who promotes his practice via the story. The story also includes a link to a website promoting alternative health services. Including at least one unbiased expert would have substantially strengthened the piece, especially a medical practitioner or researcher who did not stand to benefit from rolfing or similar CAM (complementary and alternative) therapies. Better sources of consumer information would have also strengthened the piece (E.g. http://nccam.nih.gov/health/backgrounds/manipulative.htm)   The story briefly lists unsuccessful trials of muscle relaxants, pain medications and acupuncture in the case of these patients’ experience with chronic pain and movement conditions. Rolfing is touted as \"\"life altering\"\", but both patients still manage chronic pain and movement limitations. While these patients may have found temporary relief via tissue and fascia manipulation, rolfing needs to be placed in the context of evidence-based medical therapies. The story does not list the cost of treatment. This is a great oversight in a story on a complementary therapy, which is typically not covered by health insurance and may need to be part of on-going pain management. While some health insurers may pay a portion of  therapeutic massage for some conditions, there are few regulatory bodies that guide pricing for these therapies.\"",

        "main_text": "\"The story does not list the cost of treatment. This is a great oversight in a story on a complementary therapy, which is typically not covered by health insurance and may need to be part of on-going pain management. While some health insurers may pay a portion of  therapeutic massage for some chronic conditions, there are few regulatory bodies that guide pricing for these therapies. There is no discussion of quantitative evidence that rolfing relieves pain or improves quality of life in people with movement disorders or chronic pain conditions. The story focuses solely on positive anecdotes of pain relief from two patients who sing the praises of their rolfer who promotes his practice via the story. There are few harms with massage treatment, even with deeper massage treatments such as rolfing. However, the story neglects to mention that contraindications for massage include deep vein thrombosis, burns, skin infections, eczema, open wounds, bone fractures, and advanced osteoporosis. Bodywork that involves intensive manipulation or stretching of the deeper layers of body tissue are not suitable for people who have undergone recent surgery or have recently suffered severe injury. In the case of the man who had back surgery, the story could have mentioned that there are some risks associated with manipulation of the spine (though these would be very rare with the force used in deeper massage therapies such as rolfing). Any spinal manipulation (but particularly neck) can be associated with risk in older people. The story provides no evidence from any published literature on rolfing for pain relief, or as a complementary therapy for movement disorders. The story does not mention that most complementary and alternative therapies such as rolfing are unregulated and not covered by health insurers. Also, hyperlinks provided in the story are poor sources for credible health information. Better sources include: http://nccam.nih.gov/ and http://www.parkinson.org/NETCOMMUNITY/Page.aspx?&pid=413&srcid=375 The patient \"\"horror story\"\" of developing tardive dyskinesia from antipsychotics is unusual, particularly so severe a case. The story states that the number of people with tardive dyskinesia-dystonia is unknown but then goes on to state that 40 million Americans have general movement disorders. This leaves the impression that massage therapy/rolfing may have benefits for many of these people, which is not proven. The story focuses on two patients who had positive results from rolfing. The story also interviews a rolfing practitioner. The story includes a link to a website promoting alternative health services. Including at least one unbiased, independent expert would have substantially strengthened the piece, especially a medical practitioner who did not stand to benefit from rolfing or similar CAM (complementary and alternative) therapies. A researcher of CAM therapies (perhaps someone listed on the NIH website: http://nccam.nih.gov/health/backgrounds/manipulative.htm) could have provided some balance to the story; this person could have discussed medical therapies typically used in conjunction with mind-body techniques. The story briefly lists unsuccessful trials of muscle relaxants, pain medications and acupuncture in the case of Karen Harkin’s experience with tardive dyskinesia and Wade Penn’s nerve damage. Rolfing is touted as \"\"life altering\"\", but both patients still manage chronic pain and movement limitations. While these patients may have found temporary relief via tissue and fascia manipulation, rolfing needs to be placed in the context of evidence-based medical therapies for conditions as serious as tardive dyskinesia. Most patients with this sort of severe tardive dyskinesia-dystonia or related problems would be under the care of a neurologist, where muscle relaxants and other mainstream therapies could be applied. The story does not establish how widely available and accessible are trained rolfers. The story also does not mention the type or duration of training involved to become a certified rolfer. The story could have provided much more information on both points by listing information via the Institute cited in the story: http://www.rolf.org/ The story does not discuss the relatively recent history of rolfing or its role as a complementary therapy in helping people with chronic  pain conditions improve their quality of life. We can’t be sure if the story relied solely or largely on a news release.\"",

        "post": "I'm a 21 year old senior chemistry major, and have decent grades (3.4GPA). My sophomore year I started helping tutor students, TA labs, and teach review classes for the school. I absolutely fell in love with teaching, and  still talk to tons of students that I taught!\n\nSo My father is an accomplished OBGYN, and when I first told him I was interested in teaching, he told me that I should reconsider because \"I wouldn't be able to provide for a family of 5 and be able to pay for my kids to go to college.\"  He told me that it would only be acceptable to get my doctorate and teach and consult at a university level. I talked to my cousin who is a high school English teacher, and she says she absolutely loves it! She says the pay isn't horrible and she is living comfortably. Just thinking about having an opportunity to teach people about my favorite subject just makes me giddy! My family homeschooled me my entire life, so I know that they might have a beef with the public school system...\n\nUnfortunately, my family is EXTREMELY against me being a high school teacher. They say that they would support me in any decision I make, but then every single day they pull me aside and tell me that I shouldn't do it because of the little money.

Family doesn't want me [21M] to become a high school chemistry teacher\n\nText: I'm a 21 year old senior chemistry major, and have decent grades (3.4GPA). My sophomore year I started helping tutor students, TA labs, and teach review classes for the school. I absolutely fell in love with teaching, and  still talk to tons of students that I taught!\n\nSo My father is an accomplished OBGYN, and when I first told him I was interested in teaching, he told me that I should reconsider because \"I wouldn't be able to provide for a family of 5 and be able to pay for my kids to go to college.\"  He told me that it would only be acceptable to get my doctorate and teach and consult at a university level. I talked to my cousin who is a high school English teacher, and she says she absolutely loves it! She says the pay isn't horrible and she is living comfortably. Just thinking about having an opportunity to teach people about my favorite subject just makes me giddy! My family homeschooled me my entire life, so I know that they might have a beef with the public school system...\n\nUnfortunately, my family is EXTREMELY against me being a high school teacher. They say that they would support me in any decision I make, but then every single day they pull me aside and tell me that I shouldn't do it because of the little money. They say I would be wasting my potential that God has given me. I love my family, but I really feel like teaching is something I am supposed to do. All my teachers and students say I would be an excellent teacher! How can I politely tell my family that this is something I am going to pursue regardless of what they say? I just want to be happy, and my family trying to shoot down my dreams is really making this Christmas holiday hard for me.\n\nTL;DR:",

Also, he gets pretty unresponsive in conversation. The other night we had been talking about a problem I had over text, he invited me over to talk about it with him/comfort me later that night. When I showed up he had been smoking, and that made it much harder to get feedback from him like I wanted.\n\nI don't want him to stop, he enjoys it and it is a fairly important thing to him and his friends. Mostly I would just like some kind of heads up if he has been smoking, and maybe to let him know that there are times I'd rather he not smoke (like if he knows I am coming over to talk about a problem with him)\n\nTL;DR:",

Penn made a treaty of friendship with Lenape chief Tammany under an elm tree at Shackamaxon , in what is now the city 's Fishtown neighborhood . Penn named the city Philadelphia , which is Greek for `` brotherly love , '' derived from the Ancient Greek terms φίλος phílos ( beloved , dear ) and ἀδελφός adelphós ( brother , brotherly ) . As a Quaker , Penn had experienced religious persecution and wanted his colony to be a place where anyone could worship freely . This tolerance , far more than afforded by most other colonies , led to better relations with the local native tribes and fostered Philadelphia 's rapid growth into America 's most important city .",

Unfortunately, there are few options available for prevention or treatment and this story discusses new evidence showing no benefit in terms of prevent AMD from one option, beta carotene supplements. This story manages to provide the reader with adequate information on the problem of treating AMD and the strength of the available evidence to support the use of supplements. The story adequately describes the strength of the current study and points out some of the limitations. The story also mentions that there is some evidence that beta-carotene raises the risk of lung cancer in smokers, an important harm. The story adequately quantifies the benefit of supplements by providing the actual number of cases of AMD observed in the supplement group compared to the \"\"dummy pill\"\" group. The story does mention that there is no cure for AMD (the \"\"dry\"\" form) and that supplements are really the only option currently available. However, the story misses the main point of the scientific paper, which was that beta carotene supplementation does not appear to prevent AMD in people at usual risk for the disease. In contrast, there is evidence that antioxidant supplements (those tested contain beta carotene as a component) can be used to slow progression of AMD in those who have it. Overall, a good job, and in less than 500 words (496).\"",

The story adequately describes the strength of the current study and points out some of the limitations. The story avoids disease mongering by not exaggerating the seriousness or prevalence of AMD. However, the story should have made the distinction between the different types of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The supplements in question are only used in people with the \"\"dry\"\" form of the condition, not the \"\"wet\"\" form. By not making this distinction, the story implies that the supplements can be used in everyone with the disease. The story does quote one independent expert and notes the funding sources for the investigators.

        "explanation": "\"This story unfortuantely reads like a marketing effort on the part of the manufacturer rather than objective reporting on the results of what the authors describe as an early proof of concept trial. The story suggests that the product in question (Souvenaid), \"\"…might be effective in stemming-and perhaps reversing the cognitive tolls of Alzheimer’s. \"\" While this may be true, the published article demonstrated much more limited results, ony demonstrating an improvement in one of six rating scales used.The story presents an inflated view of the study results without any significant provisos. Readers can see a striking difference between the LA Times story and one on ABCNews.com that had many more paragraphs of concerns, caveats and context. There are no effective treatments for Alzheimer’s DIsease. While there are numerous drugs available, their value in the memory loss and dementia associated with Alzheimer’s is limited. A new treatment, especially one based on a nutritional approach would be a welcomed option. However – the headline and the tone of this story raises hopes and expectations unrealistically.\"",
        "fact_checkers": " ",
        "main_text": "\"There was no mention of costs. While not yet on the market, if there are plans to begin selling it in the spring, then it is likely that the company has some estimate for what it plans to sell it for. Information on this should have been included in this piece. Subjects receiving Souvenaid only showed an improvement over the control group in one of the numerous scales used. This fact is important since the results may not be related to the Souvenaid but rather simply to chance. The results were not quantified in the story. The story did not raise the possibility that there might  be potential harms associated with this product. Considering that the trial lasted only 12 weeks and Alzheimer’s disease is a chronic condition which individuals may deal with for 10 years or more, it would have been valuable to remind readers about the very different time frame for the study as compared with disease treatment. It would only require a line to say this and would have been a reasonable admonition to include in the story. The story clearly uses hyperbole in reporting on the study results. In reality only one of the scales used demonstrated a statistical difference between Souvenaid and placebo, the study was in patients with mild Alzheimer’s symptoms and was only for 12 weeks. Suggesting the product is effective or can even reverse symptoms is a giant leap. While the story does not engage in disease mongering related to Alzheimer’s, it does note that the product may become, \"\"a voguish cocktail for aging smarties\"\" suggesting widespread need to improve memory in the US aging population. It also ends with the line that the product \"\"may be the next big thing among the middle-aged smart set.\"\" For these two reasons, we judge this unsatisfactory. There is information from a company spokesperson and from one of the study authors. There was no discussion of conflicts of interest such as corporate affiliations, patents held by authors, or sources of funding for the study reported on. No independent experts appear to have been consulted to comment for this piece. ABCNews.com, though, as one example had no difficulty including the following in its story: \"\"I see little evidence to support the use of this beverage to improve memory in [Alzheimer’s disease patients],\"\" said Dr. Paul Aisen, a noted Alzheimer’s disease expert and professor at the University of California, San Diego. \"\"It was a small study of treatment-naïve [Alzheimer’s] patients lasting only 12 weeks.\"\" By 24 weeks, the memory differences seen after 12 weeks had disappeared. The study was published in the most recent issue of the journal Alzheimer’s & Dementia. Experts also pointed out that some of the memory tests failed to show any improvement in people using the cocktail. \"\"This is a study which I would look at as negative,\"\" said Dr. Constantine Lyketsos, director of the Neuropsychiatry Service at Johns Hopkins Medical Institution. \"\"The major outcome measures showed no effect at any time point.\"\" Dr. Richard Besser, senior medical editor for ABC News, noted some troubling aspects of the study that related to its potential marketing, including conflicts of interest by the authors. \"\"They hold the patent on the nutritional cocktail and some serve on the advisory board for Dannon. The study was funded by Dannon,\"\" he said. Other experts, too, were critical of the study. \"\"While everyone would clearly like to have some safe and easy to take method to stave off Alzheimer’s disease, there are several features of this study that should raise concerns,\"\" said Dr. Clifford Saper, chairman of the Department of Neurology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. \"\"They would include the involvement of the commercial sponsors at every level of this study, including writing the first draft of the paper; and the relatively low level of improvement on a single test out of a large battery of examinations.\"\" The story mentions the drug Aricept approved for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. It mentioned that Aricept is not approved for mild cognitive impairment, suggesting that nonetheless people chose to use it for cognitive enhancement considering it to be ‘worth the risks’, without listing the risks. The product reported on was said to have shown no side effects so far by the man who has patented the combination of nutrients being marketed. While this might lead a reader to conclude that the new beverage is safer than the pharmaceutical, it would have been useful to highlight that neither has been demonstrated to be beneficial. The story mentioned that the product reported on, Souvenaid, was expected to be sold in test markets in the US in the spring. The story noted that since the product is a dietary supplement, it does not need  approval by the Food and Drug Administration before it can be marketed. Souvenaid has apparently been granted a patent, so on that basis it is likely to be a novel combination of products. The concept of a memory enhancing or sustaining diet has been suggested in numerous articles in the medical literature. From that perspective, there is really nothing unique about the approach however. Nonethless, we’ll give the story the benefit of the doubt on this criterion. We can’t be sure of the extent to which the story may have been influenced by a news release. We do know that the only sources quoted had personal vested interests in promoting the results.\"",

        "explanation": "This well written and well researched piece could have been a fantastic service for readers, one of the few stories we’ve seen to examine the medicinal claims being made by cosmetic companies for their products. Instead, it takes its cues from the same marketing it purports to examine. The story deserves credit for asking tough questions, but it should have dug deeper.It should have relied less on the cosmetic industry and its contract research organizations and more on independent experts. There are new “cures” for aging being pitched at the graying population every week, and the skin creams, laser therapies and other treatments can cost thousands with limited proof of long-term benefit. Stories that take on these claims deserve a round of applause. We hope, though, that more stories take a hard look at the way the “evidence” for these therapies is being generated and perhaps manipulated to serve a marketing aim.",
        "fact_checkers": " ",
        "main_text": "The story says that these products retail for $65 to $95. We would have liked to have seen how long one of those products would last with typical daily use. Is it $95 a month? Every three months? The reporter apparently had access to an “84-page patent application” for the product being sold, but the story does not present quantify any of the evidence that may have bene found there. Instead, it allows a company vice president to say that “a study of 30 women showed that after 10 days of using the Algenist serum, they had a 25 percent decrease in wrinkles as shown by silicone replicas of their faces.” No harms are mentioned in the story, which is too bad given that this product is apparently uNPRoven, both in labs and in the marketplace. Many would assume that there is no possible harm that could come from applying a natural product containing a seaweed compound. While that may indeed be true, there is no evidence to support that lack of any comments about potential harms. Since there are no data available about its use in premarket testing and the product has yet to reach the market, it would have been reasonable to point out that the potential harms of alguronic acid are unknown at the moment We give the story a lot of credit for taking this subject on. We think it did a great job of asking for independent reviews of the marketing claims. But the story, ultimately, presented very little in the way of analysis. It says for example that “Studies conducted by an independent lab and commissioned by Algenist, none of which have been published in a peer-reviewed journal, showed alguronic acid increased cell regeneration and the synthesis of elastin (which gives skin that snap-back youthful quality).” For most readers, the phrase “independent lab” will make them think that this product has been properly vetted. More astute readers will be concerned that the results were not “published in a peer-reviewed journal.” But we think the story should have been more cautious in presenting this information as independently generated evidence when, in fact, this is no different than any pharmaceutical company hiring researchers to prove the efficacy of its products. Dr. Dana Sachs, an associate professor of dermatology at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, says in the story “the claims on cell regeneration and elastin synthesis are based on in vitro models, which is hard to extrapolate to in vivo, and again no statistical significance is presented, so this is a weak claim.” But the story, sticking to the company’s marketing line, allows a company vice president to brush this aside by saying, “statistical significance was found but not included in press materials. And, according to the company, a study of 30 women showed that after 10 days of using the Algenist serum, they had a 25 percent decrease in wrinkles as shown by silicone replicas of their faces.” We don’t think it reasonable to provide this type of information unless there is some way to validate the claim. We think the balance of the story tips too heavily toward creating “the story” that the company wants to sell about an amazing ocean discovery. This story, like so many stories about aging, treats the natural biological process of getting older as something that can and should be fought, stopped or altered. By setting up these products as being able to “protect middle-aged faces from environmental assault,” among other phrases used in the story, it gives credence to the marketing claims and contributes to a pervasive sense that people must protect themselves somehow against aging lest they be damaged. Again,we love that the story took this company’s marketing materials and attempted to have them independently analyzed. But the story chose poorly when picking experts. After 10 paragraphs of effusive language about a new wave of ocean-derived anti-aging products, the first ostensibly critical voice in the story is given to Dr. David McDaniel, who is described as “a dermatologist and the director of the Institute of Anti-Aging Research in Virginia Beach, Va.” what does McDaniel say? He “said he was impressed by the in-vitro testing of alguronic acid. “In the petri dish, their data seems to show some substantial benefits to their active ingredient,” he said. But he cautioned that in-vitro testing does not demonstrate how a final formulation works off the shelf.” The story does not point out that the institute is a contract research organization that provides service to manufacturers including study design, laboratory testing, clinical testing and media consultations. The story does attempt to make comparisons and goes into a good amount of detail about similar products on the market, but here, again, it allows the company touting this algae-dervied product to make an unchallenged claim of superiority. “There are more than 100 algae-derived ingredients used in cosmetics worldwide, Mrs. Lewis said. The patent-pending alguronic acid in Algenist is a “single, purified, highly bioactive compound,” said Tony Day, the vice president for research and development at Solazyme, and therefore delivers “much higher activity to the skin” than products using only a microalgae extract.” We don’t think that provides readers with the sort of serious comparison they deserve, especially in a market this crowded. The story starts out by making it clear that “Algenist moisturizers, serum and eye balm are already available at Sephora.com and will go on sale in the company’s stores this week.” The story does a good job describing why the company selling this product is excited about its prospects, but it never establishes what sort of edge, if any, this product would have on the thousands of other “anti-aging” products being sold. There are hundreds of anti-aging products containing a product derived from seaweed. The suggestion that this one is somehow unique remains to be proven The story goes well beyond any news release.",

        "explanation": "\"Paul said that of the roughly 15 percent of Americans who don’t have health insurance, \"\"half of them made more than $50,000 a year.\"\" In reality, if you measure what individuals make, Census data shows that 28 percent of uninsured Americans earn $50,000.

        "fact_checkers": "Louis Jacobson",
        "main_text": "\"During a recent appearance on The Daily Show, guest host John Oliver and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., engaged in a lively exchange on health insurance and why people buy it or not. Paul, an eye surgeon, is strongly opposed to President Barack Obama’s health care law. During the interview, Oliver pressed him on how to get more Americans signed up for insurance. Paul indicated that the biggest issue is affordability, particularly for young, healthy and relatively affluent people. According to the most recent statistics, he said, \"\"85 percent of people had insurance, so 15 percent didn't. So what you need to do is look at who are the 15 percent, and why don't they have insurance? Of the 15 percent who didn't have insurance, half of them made more than $50,000 a year. Why didn't they buy insurance? Because of the expense. They were young healthy people.\"\" In this fact-check, we’ll check his claim that half of the uninsured made more than $50,000 a year. In a separate report, we’ll look at whether the cost of insurance is the biggest barrier to uninsured Americans. We’ll start by noting that Paul is very close to the mark when he says 15 percent of Americans don’t have insurance. The most recent Census Bureau statistics for 2011 show that 15.7 percent of Americans are uninsured. What about the income breakdown for that 15 percent? There are a few different ways to slice the data, but none produces a number for $50,000-plus earners that reaches the 50 percent level Paul offered on The Daily Show. In a September 2012 paper, the Employee Benefits Research Institute looked at 2011 census data on health coverage. It found that 28 percent of the uninsured earned at least $50,000. That’s quite a bit lower than what Paul had indicated. The highest plausible percentage cited by our experts -- who included both liberals and conservatives -- used census data for households rather than for individuals. Using this method, 37.5 percent of the uninsured live in a household with an income above $50,000. Why the variation between household and individual data? Uninsured young adults who are roommates might live in a household where all roommates collectively make more than $50,000, even if each roommate individually earns much less. This type of living arrangement tends to boost the count of uninsured adults who \"\"earn\"\" more than $50,000, even if they really don’t make that much individually. This difference in counting methods matters in this sort of statistical comparison because people without health insurance \"\"are more likely to be living in less-common housing arrangements -- more in multi-generation families, more living with people who aren't related to them,\"\" said Hanns Kuttner, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute. When we showed our calculations to Paul’s office, communications director Moira Bagley said there’s significant uncertainty in the Census data due to \"\"inexact data collection\"\" that \"\"under-reports the numbers of people who actually have health insurance.\"\" This refers to an argument made by some critics of Obamacare that the Census Bureau undercounts Medicaid recipients compared to the total cited by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Subtracting these uncounted Medicaid recipients leaves the pool of uninsured Americans relatively better off. However, each of the seven ideologically diverse health policy experts we talked to for this story used the census numbers when we asked them to evaluate Paul's claim, and none expressed concerns about the ability of the census data to fairly evaluate the question. Our ruling Paul said that of the roughly 15 percent of Americans who don’t have health insurance, \"\"half of them made more than $50,000 a year.\"\" In reality, if you measure what individuals make, Census data shows that 28 percent of uninsured Americans earn $50,000.

        "date_published": "February 14, 2018",
        "explanation": "A scene from the promotional video Columbia University produced about the study. Researchers in this study wanted to know if “far-UVC” light might kill H1N1, a common strain of flu virus, and therefore be used as a potential disinfectant. In addition to this TIME Health story, we also looked at coverage of this study by HealthDay. We found Time’s headline to be a bit overreaching given that this study was performed in a small test chamber (smaller than a square foot) and it’s unclear whether the disinfecting results noted would even apply to a larger space. Most importantly, both the coverage by TIME and HealthDay would have been strengthened by including supporting data from the study, as well as a discussion of the limitations. It’s been a rough flu season. And there is no cure for the flu, just preventive measures and symptom management. So any research that suggests that one strain of the flu virus can be killed without side effects to humans is bound to get a lot of attention. This means news coverage — at the very least — needs to present supportive data and ask researchers directly about limitations. This is particularly true of controlled in vitro studies — studies like this small test chamber study which take place outside of living organisms — since they rarely correlate directly with complex living organisms in an uncontrolled and changing environment.",
        "fact_checkers": "Michael Joyce, MD,Ishani Ganguli, MD, MPH,Joy Victory",
        "main_text": "The lead author of the study is quoted as saying “The lamp we’re using at the moment costs less than $1,000, and you can imagine that if it were put into general circulation, the price would drop dramatically … we don’t see cost as being a limited factor here.” The first part of the quote gives a frame of reference, though “less than $1,000” is somewhat ambiguous. The second part also is speculative, so this is a barely passing satisfactory. We’re told: “… aerosolized particles of the H1N1 seasonal flu virus were released into a test chamber and exposed to very low doses of far-UVC light. The light inactivated the viruses with about the same efficiency as conventional germicidal UV light, while a control group of bacteria, not exposed to light, remained active.” We’re also told previous studies by the same authors have shown that far-UVC light “can kill MRSA bacteria, a common cause of infections after surgery.” However, it would be helpful to have data to support these claims, but that’s not provided. No harms of far-UVC light are mentioned; in fact, in the opening sentence we read:  “researchers have developed an ultraviolet (UV) lamp that kills influenza virus but isn’t harmful to human skin or eyes….” But, again, we’re given no data regarding safety. We are not told if the previous skin or eye studies (which we’re told prove the safety of this approach) were done in the laboratory or on real humans. The limitations of this in vitro study are not discussed. We’re not told what percent of the viruses were killed. Nor do we get any sense of whether findings from a test chamber can be applied to large public spaces as the story headline implies. In the published study the lead author cautions that the results need to be “confirmed in other scenarios.” It would have helped readers to include this. No disease mongering. The lead author of the story is the only source cited, and we’re not told if he has any conflicts of interest. The HealthDay story we reviewed rated better on this criteria. No mention is made that there is no cure for any of the strains of influenza virus and, therefore, most interventions focus solely on prevention and symptom management. This is important information to include when both your opening and closing paragraphs imply the far-UVC light studied might prevent the spread of the flu in public places. This is a just passing satisfactory–it’s implied that the product is not available yet, because the story mentioned the lead author “is working with a company to develop a commercially available version of the lamp.” It is made clear the authors have studied this type of light in killing methicillin-resistant staph. aureus (MRSA), but it’s not clear if the current study is the first to apply far-UVC light to an influenza virus (in the published study the authors claim this is the first time far-UVC light has been assessed for inactivating aerosolized viruses). While the story didn’t offer much more than what was stated in the news release, it does appear to contain original quotes.",

But we think of the four we quickly found -- Ukraine downed MH 17 to drum up sympathy, AIDS drugs are what are killings AIDS patients, 9/11 was an inside job, and an assistant secretary of state devised a plan to break-up Ukraine -- at least one would fit most people’s definition of a conspiracy theory. Lavelle’s hypothesis about MH 17, we should note, was uttered in the breaths after saying he doesn’t allow conspiracy theories on his show.\"",

        "main_text": "\"Peter Lavelle hosts CrossTalk on RT, an English language cable news network funded by the Russian government. Lavelle opens each edition of CrossTalk by saying it’s a place \"\"where all things are considered.\"\" Everything except, he says, conspiracy theories. Lavelle’s commentary on Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 thrust him into the media spotlight with a contentious, 10-minute interview with CNN’s Chris Cuomo, who accused Lavelle of being obsessed with \"\"clearing Russia from culpability\"\" in the plane’s shooting. American officials have said the plane was likely shot down by Ukrainian separatists in Donetsk with a surface-to-air missile. Lavelle, an American who works as a journalist in Moscow, says the United States is too quick to tie Russian-backed rebels to the tragedy, berating the U.S. State Department for relying on social media as evidence for its claims and not looking at Ukraine as a responsible party. \"\"I'm not a conspiracy theorist and I never allow conspiracy theorists on my program,\"\" Lavelle said on the July 23 CrossTalk, addressing guest Vladimir Suchan. Then Lavelle proposed a theory that involves Ukraine bringing down the plane in effort to earn worldwide sympathy amid woes with its new government. \"\"But if I look at the timing of this tragedy in Ukraine, the (Petro) Poroshenko government was, well, in trouble with its latest offensive in the east, it was losing badly, soldiers were being circled, it was really bad news,\"\" Lavelle said. \"\"And all of a sudden we have this tragedy of killing civilians on this flight, and this puts Ukraine back on the front page, it competes with Gaza, a lot of ‘sympathy,’ for the Kiev regime, this is good timing in a way for the coup regime that hasn't been achieving too many successes since February.\"\" Um, so in essence Lavelle is suggesting Ukraine shot down MH 17 so it could blame the Russian separatists so the flailing Ukraine government could become front-and-center again in the news? Sounds like a conspiracy theory to us. But so that we don’t be accused of reaching a  conclusion too quickly, we decided to search around Lavelle’s other shows. We didn’t search every program, but we looked at enough to find that conspiracy theories are very much raised by Lavelle and featured on his show. RT is a curiosity for Western journalists, some of whom see its coverage as Kremlin-directed propaganda. As a star host, Lavelle has gotten and dismissed questions about the network's perceived bias. In 2008, he told a New York Times reporter, \"\"No one is telling me what to say.\"\" He did, however, note that part of the network's \"\"mission is public relations.\"\" RT has also carved out a reputation for bringing in obscure guests to discuss unusual topics related to America, devoting time to questioning President Barack Obama’s birth certificate. Lavelle, too, has expressed his preference to be \"\"counterintuitive\"\" compared to corporate-owned American cable news networks. In a 2010 interview with Columbia Journalism Review, Lavelle said, \"\"Being mainstream has been very dangerous for the West.\"\" Here’s a few of those conspiratorial, er, counterintuitive moments that we found with a simple Google search. Conspiracy No. 1: 9/11 was an inside job Lavelle invited several skeptics of the American government's Sept. 11 findings \"\"to try to find out what really happened\"\" on 9/11 for a March 2010 segment. The roster included Architects and Engineers for 9/11 Truth founder Richard Gage, who said three World Trade Center skyscrapers (the Twin Towers and a surrounding WTC building) that collapsed that day \"\"were brought down by explosive demolition on 9/11, not by fire and jet plane impacts.\"\" Lavelle also asked blogger Ian Henshall, a blogger and author of 9/11 Revealed: The New Evidence, about what it's like to be called a conspiracy theorist when he's just raising questions. \"\"Conspiracy theory, if it means anything, is a simple story which you know claims to explain a major complicated event. That is exactly what the official story of the 9/11 attacks is,\"\" Henshall said. \"\"Very simple story, all organized by a guy in the cave with 17 hijackers who were just incredibly lucky. You could not get more of a conspiracy theory than that.\"\" Henshall went on to talk about the \"\"worrying evidence\"\" that the towers-takedown was an inside job. Just so we don't raise the eyebrows of conspiracy theorists, we took three screengrabs of Lavelle and his guests talking about 9/11 conspiracy theories from RT's YouTube page: 1. \"\"WTC towers collapsed due to a controlled demolition;\"\"   2. \"\"Attacks an inside job to justify wars in Afghanistan and Iraq;\"\"   3. \"\"9/11 attacks in 2001 were intentionally allowed to happen.\"\" It wasn't the first time Lavelle raised eyebrows about the official story of Sept. 11. In February 2010, Lavelle posited on CrossTalk that the Sept. 11 hijackers were \"\"not even fundamentalists at all\"\" -- much to the shock of the two people he was interviewing about a proposed burqa ban in France. This time he was challenged by a guest, former British journalist Douglas Murray of the Centre for Social Adhesion, who asked Lavelle, \"\"How can you keep speaking, let alone hosting a show, and know so little? How can you know so little and keep on talking?\"\" Murray detailed the appearance on the \"\"strange propaganda outfit\"\" in a blogpost. The other guest, Anne-Elisabeth Moutet of the Jean-Jacques Rousseau Institute, said al-Qaida is a completely fundamentalist group. Conspiracy No. 2: AIDS drugs kill people with AIDS Lavelle later convened a panel to talk about the business of HIV/AIDS on July 21, 2010, asking questions that highlighted critics of antiretroviral therapy for people infected with HIV who say the treatments are nothing but a \"\"huge moneybag\"\" for Big Pharma. Lavelle invited on guest Peter Duesberg, a University of California-Berkeley professor of molecular and cell biology, who believes that AIDS treatments are killing people infected with \"\"the so-called AIDS virus, which doesn’t do anything.\"\" So AIDS isn’t killing people, AIDS drugs are. \"\"The companies try to treat the virus that doesn’t do anything with drugs that are inevitably toxic,\"\" Duesberg said. \"\"The AZT was developed 40 years ago for one purpose: to kill human cells for cancer, chemotherapy. And the result is they have never ever cured one AIDS patient.\"\" Lavelle asked Dr. Denis Broun of UNAIDS for feedback. \"\"We have 2 million people die of HIV infection every year. And these are not people who die of old age, I can tell you that. The average age of people who die in Russia is 32 years. This is preposterous,\"\" Broun said. \"\"The antiretrovirals are keeping people alive, and people are staying alive thanks to administration of these products.\"\" Lavelle went back to Duesberg, who said the world’s 30-40 million HIV-infected population is doing well and the people who die are the ones \"\"getting these drugs that are inevitably toxic.\"\" ‘They are designed to terminate DNA synthesis, that’s the central molecule of life, you’re dying from that,\"\" Duesberg said. \"\"That is AIDS by prescription. And 500,000 people are prescribed these drugs alone in the U.S. and all of them die, about half of them die from diseases that have nothing to do with HIV.\"\" Another guest, Steve Caterer of Global Pharma Insights, said Duesberg’s opinions \"\"on the good side are disrespectful and on the worst side are tantamount to murder.\"\" Later in the program, Broun said the three-drug HIV/AIDS drug treatment used today is much less toxic than the AZT-only treatment (azidothymidine) used 25 years ago. \"\"No one in his right sense is suggesting to use AZT alone today,\"\" he said. \"\"It's as if people were suggesting to treat syphilis with arsenic, as was done at the beginning of the century. ... We cannot discuss today's situation with antique data that are no longer valid in any way.\"\" Broun said researchers debate some points of treating the virus, but \"\"no one is saying, like denying the role of HIV in creating AIDS or saying the drugs are dangerous for people.\"\" Conspiracy No. 3: U.S. official planned to break up Ukraine Back to Ukraine, where Lavelle lambasted American media coverage of the \"\"Western-induced crisis\"\" in May 2014, and claimed that Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Victoria Nuland was trying to break up Ukraine. \"\"It seems to me that there’s this habit now in Western media, particularly in the United States, that no one wants to see fault in themselves or their own governments here. Because this was so predictable, as you said at the beginning of the program, this plan that Victoria Nuland had was just nonsense. She was just going to break up the country, but they had a Plan B. If they don’t succeed, then Russia is a very easy enemy to blame everything on, and that’s exactly what we’re seeing right now.\"\" Even guest Dmitry Babich, an employee of the Russian-government owned radio station The Voice of Russia, thought Lavelle was going a bit too far. \"\"I don’t think Victoria Nuland planned to break up the country. She thought that the east of Ukraine would just submit to the new government, the new government would be pro-Western, then as the Western media said, we should all take deep breath and then wait until Ukraine becomes completely anti-Russian,\"\" Babich said. \"\"And of course Victoria Nuland, just like John Kerry, they don’t know a thing about Ukraine.\"\" Nuland became a notorious figure in the East as U.S. diplomats responded to Ukraine's political crisis, but there's no evidence she had a plan to break up Ukraine. A phone conversation between Nuland and U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt about Ukraine's next steps was leaked, in which she was heard as saying \"\"F--- the EU.\"\" Routine remarks from Nuland about the United States' investment in pro-democracy initiatives in Ukraine since it broke off from the Soviet Union in 1991 were widely misconstrued on social media and by RT, which held up her comments as evidence that the U.S. was spending $5 billion to incite the riots (a claim we rated ). Our ruling \"\"Never\"\" is a strong word, yet Lavelle claimed he is a not a conspiracy theorist and has \"\"never allowed a conspiracy theorist on his show.\"\" We’ll agree there is a somewhat subjective definition of what constitutes a conspiracy theory. But we think of the four we quickly found -- Ukraine downed MH 17 to drum up sympathy, AIDS drugs are what are killings AIDS patients, 9/11 was an inside job, and an assistant secretary of state devised a plan to break-up Ukraine -- at least one would fit most people’s definition of a conspiracy theory. Lavelle’s hypothesis about MH 17, we should note, was uttered in the breaths after saying he doesn’t allow conspiracy theories on his show.\"",

He proposes obtaining confirmation of the pipe 's contents by inviting a fellow wine aficionado , Luchesi , for a private tasting . Montresor knows Fortunato will not be able to resist demonstrating his discerning palate for wine and will insist that he taste the amontillado rather than Luchesi who , as he claims , `` can not tell Amontillado from Sherry '' . Fortunato goes with Montresor to the wine cellars of the latter 's palazzo , where they wander in the catacombs . Montresor offers wine ( first Medoc , then De Grave ) to Fortunato in order to keep him inebriated . Montresor warns Fortunato , who has a bad cough , of the dampness , and suggests they go back , but Fortunato insists on continuing , claiming that `` ( he ) shall not die of a cough '' . During their walk , Montresor mentions his family coat of arms : a golden foot in a blue background crushing a snake whose fangs are embedded in the foot 's heel , with the motto Nemo me impune lacessit ( `` No one attacks me with impunity '' ) .",

        "date_published": "September 13, 2004",
        "explanation": "Fanta is still a Coca-Cola product, and today it comes in seventy different flavors (though only some are available within each of the 188 countries it is sold in).",
        "fact_checkers": "Snopes Staff",
        "main_text": "The histories of a number of popular consumer items have been rumored to have at least tenuous connections with certain unsavory elements. Contemporary lore is rife with product rumors that assert ties to the Ku Klux Klan (e.g., Marlboro cigarettes, Snapple fruit drinks, KFC, Troop clothing, Tropical Fantasy fruit drink) and the Nazis (e.g., Coors beer), groups mainstream American society views as evil. Such rumors are wholly without substance. Of all the product rumors of this class, only those associating the soft drink Fanta with Nazi Germany have anything to them, and even then, the truth of the matter is far more innocuous than the whispers. We’ve seen the Fanta/Nazi rumor rendered a number of ways, including: It is the last that is closest to the truth; the other three are naught but canard. Prior to the outbreak of the second world war, Coca-Cola’s only unqualified success on the international scene was its bottling operations in Nazi Germany. Sales records were being set year after year in that venue, and by 1939 Coca-Cola had 43 bottling plants and more than 600 local distributors in that country. However, the war was about to change that. As the inevitable clash loomed ever closer, obtaining the key ingredients necessary for the production of Coca-Cola syrup became increasingly difficult in Germany, grinding production towards a standstill. In 1938, the man in charge of Coca-Cola’s operations in Germany, American-born Ray Powers, died of injuries received in an automobile accident. His right-hand man, German-born Max Keith, took over: Meanwhile, the German government placed Max Keith in charge of Coca-Cola’s properties in the occupied countries, and he sent word through Coca-Cola’s bottler in neutral Switzerland that he would try to keep the enterprises alive. But with no means of getting ingredients, Keith stopped making Coca-Cola and began marketing an entirely new soft drink he called Fanta, a light-colored beverage that resembled ginger ale. [Allen, 1994] Fanta came by its name thanks to Keith’s instructions to employees during the contest to christen the beverage — he told them to let their Fantasie [Geman for fantasy] run wild. Upon hearing that, veteran salesman Joe Knipp immediately blurted out Fanta. This new soda was often made from the leavings of other food industries. (Remember, Germany did have a bit of an import problem at that time.) Whey (a cheese by-product) and apple fiber from cider presses found their way into the drink. As for which fruits were used in the formulation, it all depended on what was available at the time. In its earliest incarnations, the drink was sweetened with saccharin, but by 1941 its concocters were permitted to use 3.5 percent beet sugar. Fanta sold well enough to keep the plants operating and Coca-Cola people employed. In 1943, 3 million cases of Fanta were vended, but not all were imbibed — some were used to flavor soups and stews. (Sugar rationing inspired many a housewife to look to unusual sources for that which could no longer be bought outright in large enough quantities to satisfy.) Until the end of the war, Coca-Cola executives in Atlanta did not know if Keith was working for the company or for the Nazis, because communication with him was impossible. Their misgivings aside, Keith was safeguarding Coca-Cola interests and people during that period of no contact. It was thanks largely to his efforts that Coca-Cola was able to re-establish production in Germany virtually immediately after World War II. According to a report prepared by an investigator commissioned by Coca-Cola to examine Max Keith’s actions during that unsupervised period, Keith had never been a Nazi, even though he’d been repeatedly pressured to become one and indeed had endured hardships because of his refusal. He also could have made a fortune for himself by bottling and selling Fanta under his own name. Instead, in the face of having to work for the German government, he kept the Coca-Cola plants in Germany running and various Coca-Cola men alive throughout the war. At the end of the conflict, he welcomed the Coca-Cola company back to its German operations and handed over both the profits from the war years and the new soft drink. So where does all this leave the question of who or what invented Fanta and why? The truth is simple, even if it doesn’t run trippingly off the tongue: Fanta was the creation of a German-born Coca-Cola man who was acting without direction from Atlanta. This man wasn’t a Nazi, nor did he invent the drink at the direction of the Third Reich. Rather, in an effort to preserve Coca-Cola company assets and protect its people by way of keeping local plants operating, he formulated a new soft drink when it became impossible to produce the company’s flagship product.",

        "background": "Affirmed (February 21, 1975 - January 12, 2001) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse who was the eleventh winner of the United States Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing. Affirmed was also known for his famous rivalry with Alydar, whom he met ten times, including in all three Triple Crown races. Affirmed was the last horse to win the Triple Crown for a 37-year period, which was ended in 2015 by American Pharoah. Affirmed won fourteen Grade",
        "section_title": "The Triple Crown",
        "context": "Alydar was made the 6-5 favorite for Kentucky Derby, with Affirmed the second choice at 9-5 and undefeated Sensitive Prince the third choice at 9-2. At the start of the Kentucky Derby, Sensitive Prince took the early lead as Affirmed ran in third through the early stages, while Alydar stayed far back. Affirmed made a strong move for the lead on the far turn, put away a challenge by Wood Memorial winner Believe It, and held off Alydar's fast-closing charge to win by 1 1/2 lengths. Affirmed now had a 5-2 edge in the series.  In the Preakness Stakes, Affirmed set the pace. Alydar made his big move on the far turn, at the same point in the race where Affirmed made his winning move in the Derby. Affirmed held a short lead entering the stretch and held it to defeat Alydar by a neck.  Alydar's partisans assumed that the 1 1/2 mile distance of the Belmont, two furlongs longer than the Derby and 5/16 of a mile longer than the Preakness Stakes, would favor Alydar with his finishing style and staying pedigree, and he would deny Affirmed the Triple Crown. Trainer Veitch removed Alydar's blinkers for the Belmont, saying that if Alydar got a better look at Affirmed, maybe he would get by him.  In the Belmont, Affirmed led and set a very slow pace, going the first quarter mile in 25 seconds and the half in 50 seconds. Alydar's jockey, Jorge Velasquez, put Alydar close to the pace, and moved alongside Affirmed with more than seven furlongs to go. For more than six furlongs (half the distance of the race), the colts raced neck and neck, pulling away from the rest of the field. Alydar got his nose in front at mid-stretch, but just as Affirmed appeared to tire, Cauthen went to a left-handed whip, something he had never done before in his eight rides on Affirmed. Affirmed won by a nose to become racing's 11th (and last winner for 37 years until American Pharoah won in 2015), Triple Crown winner. After the third slowest start in Belmont Stakes history, they raced the fastest last mile in Belmont Stakes history, 3/4 in 1:14, the mile in 1:37 2/5 and finished in 2:26 4/5. It was, at the time, the third fastest Belmont ever, behind Secretariat and Gallant Man.  His Triple Crown win set two records: the shortest and longest gaps between the previous and next Triple Crown winners. Affirmed's win in 1978 was the first time the Triple Crown had been won in consecutive years (Seattle Slew won in 1977). Affirmed's win also marked the start of the longest gap until the next Triple Crown winner, with American Pharoah's win on June 6, 2015 occurring 37 years later. CANNOTANSWER",

(2) Последний вспоминает о недавно опубликованной в газете статье Раскольникова «О преступлении», предлагая автору разъяснить свою «теорию» о «двух разрядах людей». (3) Получается, что «обыкновенное» («низшее») большинство всего лишь материал для воспроизводства себе подобных, именно оно нуждается в строгом моральном законе и обязано быть послушным. (4) Это «твари дрожащие».

(6) Эти «преступники» затем становятся «новыми законодателями». (7) Таким образом, не признавая библейских заповедей («не убий», «не укради» и др.), Раскольников «разрешает» «право имеющим» — «кровь по совести». (8) Умный и проницательный Порфирий разгадывает в герое идеологического убийцу, претендующего на роль нового Наполеона.

        "date_published": "December 15, 2008",
        "explanation": "\"This story is an interesting twist to the usual health news article reviewed on this site. It comes from a regular column, \"\"The Unreal World,\"\" in the LA Times that reviews health issues in prime time TV shows. The story provides an overview of a recent episode of a popular TV show – Boston Legal (ABC, Dec 1) and then addresses the clinical content of the show in a point-by-point manner. The episode continues a story line about a lead character Denny Crane, played by William Shatner, who has been diagnosed with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease. Crane/Shatner’s memory loss is progressing so he takes legal action (all the way to the supreme court) to gain access to an experimental drug which has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The aspects of this dramatization related to Alzheimer’s disease symptoms and stages, PET scans of the brain, the experimental drug Dimebon, and the FDA approval drug approval process are accurate. The article is well organized, raising and summarizing the relevant clinical issues, addressing the medical questions in depth and evaluating their portrayal in the TV show. The column omits some basic information we wish it had included such as quantifying the benefits seen with Dimebon, something on the harms seen with it, and a reminder that available medications for Alzheimer’s can help a small number of people but only for a limited amount of time.\"",
        "fact_checkers": " ",
        "main_text": "The cost of the drug is not particularly relevant in this case. This story points out the potential benefits of Dimebon based upon preliminary research, but didn’t quantify those benefits. These include improved cognition, memory and ability to perform activities of daily living. These potential benefits should have been placed in the context of existing medications which have shown a very modest effect in these outcomes, in only one-third of people, and for a short-period of time. Little is know about the long-term use of these medications. The story references general concerns of experimental drugs which do not have proven effectiveness or safety. Potential harms of Dimebon were not mentioned. However, the research study about the Dimebon published in The Lancet reported that dry mouth was the most common side effect. For reference, there can be gastrointestinal side effects from currently approved medications. These are usually dose related and can be minimised by taking the medications with food and gradually increasing the dose overtime. This story takes a point-by-point approach to evaluate the medical issues related to Alzheimer’s disease raised in the TV episode. The Premise section provides a good, basic description of PET scan brain imaging and symptoms of mild to moderate memory loss. The story should have clearly noted that PET scans do not provide a definitive diagnosis and that tests to evaluate memory such as questionnaires and neurological examinations, are routinely performed as the first line of evaluation. The piece does provide an appropriate level of depth in its discussion of the experimental nature of Dimebon, results of research conducted in Russia, and the stages of the FDA approval process. Basics facts about the prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease were not provided, but would have helped readers to understand how many people are affected (about 15% over 70 years old). Given that, Alzheimer’s disease was accurately characterized in the story. The story includes interviews from an independent medical expert and the chief medical officer for the Alzheimer’s Association (www.alz.org). This story could have been enhanced by adding that there are currently no cures for Alzheimer’s disease. It should have noted that available medications can help a small number of people but only for a limited amount of time. This story clearly indicates that the experimental drug Dimebon is not available in the U.S. It also notes that the drug won’t be available for at least three years, pending FDA approval. The story indicates that Dimebon is a new and experimental drug to treat Alzheimer’s disease. This story does not rely on a press release.",

        "date_published": "",
        "explanation": "Federal agents took down an alleged Medicare scam Friday that exploited seniors’ curiosity about genetic medicine by enticing them to get their cheeks swabbed for unneeded DNA tests. Medicare was billed $2.1 billion.",
        "fact_checkers": " Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar",
        "main_text": "Dubbed “Operation Double Helix,” the crackdown targeted telemedicine companies, doctors and labs, in a joint effort by the Justice Department , the FBI, U.S. attorneys’ offices, and the Health and Human Services inspector general. Thirty-five people were charged around the country. The alleged fraud flourished at a time when many people are getting DNA tests to trace back their family heritage. Fraudsters preyed on people’s fears of harboring genetic markers for cancer. However, genetic testing is not routinely used to screen for cancer. “A decade ago, it would have given Medicare beneficiaries pause if someone wanted to get a swab from their cheek of their saliva,” said Shimon Richmond, who heads the inspector general’s investigative division . “Today people know and recognize what (genetic testing) is, and they think ‘I can get that done, and I can get it done for free and find out if I have health issues that I need to address.’” It’s a bad decision, said Richmond. Not only does it put the patient’s Medicare ID in the hands of fraudsters who can then keep reselling it for illicit purposes, but it can potentially compromise unique details of an individual’s make-up. Another downside: Medicare might deny future coverage for genetic testing when it’s really needed, since the patient’s record would show such an analysis was already done. Patients should only have genetic testing if their own doctor orders it, officials said. The alleged scheme worked like this: Officials said a telemarketing or in-person “recruiter” would convince a Medicare enrollee to take a genetic test, assuring them that the program would pay the full cost. The patient would provide their Medicare information. A doctor in league with the fraudsters would approve the test, and collect a kickback from the recruiter company. A lab participating in the scheme would run the test, bill Medicare, and share payments collected from the government with the recruiter. Bills to Medicare connected with the scam typically ranged from $7,000 to $12,000, Richmond said, with some much higher. In many cases the patient never got a report back, or the results provided were incomprehensible. Medicare paid out hundreds of millions of dollars before authorities detected the fraud and moved in. There was no single organization behind the fraud. Friday’s operation targeted defendants in Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas, the Justice Department said. Nine doctors were among those charged. Others included owners of telemedicine companies and testing labs. Medicare enrollee Linda Morris of Parker City, Indiana, said she was roped in at a conference on aging well. The retired high school math and journalism teacher got her cheek swabbed by one of the many health vendors at the event. “Their ploy was, ‘Get a mouth swab and we can analyze how well your system synthesizes the drugs you are taking,’” she said. “It never crossed my mind there was anything wrong with this.” Then her Medicare statements started coming in, showing charges as high as $33,000. The program paid almost $10,000. Morris said she was never billed, and was never sent results. When she looked up the address for the test vendor it was “a house on a back road.” “I feel stupid, and in the meantime, I’m furious,” Morris said. Health fairs, church events, and senior centers are like magnets for the fraudsters, officials said. Dennie Krivokapich of Farmington, New Mexico, said he almost sent in his cheek swab following a telemarketing pitch. The retired accountant is a three-time cancer survivor and concerned about his future risk. The company sent him a kit, but the paperwork that came with it made him suspicious. “The physician who requested it was not my physician,” said Krivokapich. The marketing company kept calling him, until he blocked the number. Government-backed anti-fraud organizations known as the Senior Medicare Patrol have been trying to spread the word about genetic testing scams. Retired federal investigator Jennifer Trussell, a consultant to the groups, said fear of cancer is the scam artists’ most effective tool. “These are bad actors trying to take advantage of good medicine,” she said. Fraud against government health care programs is a pervasive problem that costs taxpayers tens of billions of dollars a year. The true extent is unknown. Experts say part of the problem is that Medicare is required to pay medical bills promptly, which means money often goes out before potential frauds get flagged. Investigators call that “pay and chase.” In recent years, Medicare has tried to adapt techniques used by credit card companies to head off fraud. Law enforcement coordination has grown, with strike forces of federal prosecutors and agents, along with state counterparts, specializing in health care investigations.",

        "date_published": "September 8, 2010",
        "explanation": "We wish more stories focused their coverage on the lack of good evidence supporting commonly used medical treatments, as this NPR story about remedies for morning sickness did. We also appreciate this story’s decision to cover a Cochrane Library systematic review–among the most authoritative evaluations of medical evidence available in the literature today. Still, a skeptical outlook cannot substitute for a thorough analysis of the evidence — something which this story came close to but ultimately did not provide to readers. In addition, high quality source material cannot make up for a story’s failure to provide an independent perspective. Overall this was a solid effort that met most of our criteria and communicated the key points well. A bit more detail in a few areas would have increased the story’s value to readers. Morning sickness is common and can range from a minor annoyance to a life-threatening condition. It takes a significant toll on women and our economy via lost work days, increased anxiety, physical symptoms and reduced overall quality of life. Women who experience morning sickness inevitably are going to receive conflicting recommendations from doctors, family, and friends about the best way to deal with the condition. This story delivers an important message about the lack of good evidence supporting any specific therapy.",
        "fact_checkers": " ",
        "main_text": "\"There wasn’t any discussion of costs of these treatments. The point of the story was tell readers that these treatments couldn’t be recommended on the basis of medical evidence. Even in an overview of available treatments, some cost information is important for readers, especially given the fact that regular acupuncture treatments are going to cost a lot more than vitamin B-6. How much money are people wasting on these treatments? A mixed bag here, but ultimately unsatisfactory in our view. The story does note that there \"\"wasn’t much hard data\"\" on psychological, social or economic outcomes — all of which are important to look at considering the lost work time, anxiety, and reduced quality of life that women may experience because of morning sickness. But then the story goes on to state that there was \"\"some evidence\"\" that ginger, vitamin B-6 and anti-vomiting drugs relieved nausea. Well, how much evidence was there and what exactly did it show? While the story states that the evidence for these treatments \"\"isn’t strong enough to make a recommendation,\"\" we feel the story should have tried to quantify this benefit in a way that would be meaningful for readers, whether as episodes of nausea/vomiting or some other \"\"real world\"\" outcome. The story noted that most of the studies included in the review didn’t include enough information about potential harms — \"\"something everyone would certainly want to know.\"\" We’ll call this satisfactory, but we wish it had included at least some information about the harms that were mentioned, such as heartburn in patients taking ginger and drowsiness in patients taking anti-nausea medications. The Cochrane systematic review discussed in this article is actually a \"\"study of studies.\"\" In this case, the story told us how many clinical trials were included in the review (27) and how many women participated in those studies (about 4,000). The story told us why the included studies, which at first glance might seem like an impressive volume of research, couldn’t provide reliable answers about the effectiveness of morning sickness treatments. The story noted that many of studies used different methods and had different ways of measuring outcomes, so the results couldn’t be pooled together to increase the statistical power of the analysis. The lead overstates the case a bit by saying that the review concluded that there was \"\"no reliable treatment to relieve vomiting and feelings of nausea in early-term pregnant women.\"\" But, in the third paragraph, the story says, \"\"Dublin City University’s Anne Matthews, the review’s lead researcher, says it was disappointing not to find more studies that were consistent in testing the same approaches. Without enough data that could be pooled together, it wasn’t possible for the Cochrane folks to figure out if anything really works reliably and safely.\"\" It would have been nice to see Cochrane’s methods evaluated as closely as those of any other type of research experiment. But it didn’t provide key information about how the researchers selected which studies to include in the review. We don’t know, for example, whether the included studies were randomized controlled trials or if uncontrolled trials were allowed. We also don’t know if the studies had to be of a certain size or quality to be included. This information is vital to understanding the strength of the review’s conclusions. This story didn’t exaggerate the effects of morning sickness. The only source quoted in the article was an author of the study being covered. As we discussed in our review of the competing LA Times piece, one could argue that this criterion should be ruled not applicable in this case since the Cochrane group authors are, by definition, an independent group of evaluators. Since other experts do sometimes dispute the way in which Cochrane authors analyze the evidence, however, we feel it would have added value to include the voice of another expert who wasn’t affiliated with the study. The story discusses many different treatments for morning sickness and reports that they all lack good-quality evidence to support their use. The whole point of the story was to discuss the most commonly used treatments for morning sickness: acupuncture, acupressure, ginger, vitamin B-6 and conventional anti-vomiting drugs. The novelty of the treatments analyzed in the review isn’t really in question, so we’ll call this not applicable. The story includes an interview with one of the authors of the study and doesn’t include any direct duplication of text from this press release. So we feel pretty confident that it didn’t rely exclusively on a release for its content.\"",

This may explain why they are relatively free of disease and live exceptionally long lives compared with other mammals of similar size, such as the rat, said Professor Lin-Fa Wang, an infectious disease expert at the Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School in Singapore who led the multi-centre study. “We are not saying bats never get sick or never get infections. What we are saying is they handle infections a lot better,” Wang said in a telephone interview. What was missing from both species of bats was a gene segment known to trigger extreme, and potentially fatal, immune reactions to infections, called the cytokine storm. Cytokine storms end up killing not only offending viruses in the body, but the host’s own cells and tissues too. “Viruses rarely kill the host. The killing comes from the host’s immune response. So it looks like what bats are doing is depress the inflammation (cytokine storm). If we can learn that, we can design drugs to minimize the inflammation damage and control viral infection,” Wang said. The study, which saw the participation of researchers from China, Denmark, Australia and the United States, was published on Friday in the journal Science. Compared with other mammals of similar size, bats live a long time, with lifespans of between 20 and 40 years. Rats live between 2 and 3 years, on average. Interestingly, Wang and his colleagues found that the highly evolved genes that give bats their superior immune system also enable them to fly. Out of more than 5,000 types of mammals on the planet, bats are the only one capable of sustained flight and some species can fly more than 1,000 km in a single night. Such intense physical exertion is known to produce toxic “free radicals” that cause tissue damage and it is these same genes that give the bat the ability to repair itself, Wang said. “What we found was the genes that evolved fastest were genes involved in repairing DNA damage. That makes sense ... because when you fly, metabolism goes up and it generates free radicals that are toxic to cells,” Wang said. “Because bats fly, they (would have had) to evolve and adapt ... to get genes that can repair DNA damage.”  Wang said we have much to learn from the bat, which has evolved to avoid disease and live exceptionally long lives. “Cancer, ageing and infectious disease, these are the three major areas of concern for people,” he said. “We have studied rats for 150 years to understand how to do better in these three areas. Now we have a system, the bat, that has done very well in evolution. We can learn from the bat. With modern techniques, we can design new drugs to slow down the ageing process, treat cancer, fight infections.”",

        "fact_checkers": "Louis Jacobson",
        "main_text": "\"A reader recently sent us a chain email we hadn’t seen before. The lengthy missive, purportedly written by a \"\"senior gentleman in Mesa, Arizona,\"\" details a visit to a hospital made contentious by Medicare payment rules. The anonymous author claims to have experienced \"\"a medical situation that made it very clear that the ‘Affordable Care Act’ is neither affordable, nor do they care.\"\" The full email, which is lengthy, is accessible in its entirety here. But briefly, the author relates what happened after he sought treatment for a suspected urinary-tract infection. After collapsing in a local urgent-care clinic, he was taken to a hospital. There, the medical staff feared he could be experiencing sepsis, a potentially serious inflammation caused by an infection, so they ordered a battery of tests, including one that could take a day or two to complete. As a result, they told him that he would need to stay in the hospital \"\"for observation\"\" rather than going home. Here’s what happened next: \"\"I said, ‘Doctor, correct me if I'm wrong, but if you admit me for observation, my Medicare will not pay anything. This is due to the Affordable Care Act.’ He said, ‘That's right, it won't.’ I then grabbed for my bag of clothing and said, ‘Then I'm going home.’ He said you're really too sick to be going home, but I understand your position. This health program is going to hit seniors especially hard.\"\" Then another doctor came into the room. \"\"I said, ‘Doc, you and I both know that under the Affordable Care Act anyone on Medicare who is admitted to a hospital for observation will be responsible for the bill. Medicare won't pay a cent.’ At which point he nodded in affirmation. I said, ‘You will either admit me for a specific treatment or you won't admit me.’ Realizing he wasn't going to win this one, he said he would prepare my release papers.\"\" We zeroed in on the core claim of this story, that \"\"under the Affordable Care Act, anyone on Medicare who is admitted to a hospital for observation will be responsible for the bill. Medicare won't pay a cent.\"\" When we looked into it, we found that Medicare does indeed have different reimbursement policies for patients who had been admitted to hospitals for observation as opposed to being admitted to treat a specific diagnosis. However, the email’s author (and, if his recounting is accurate, each of the medical professionals he spoke to) were sorely misinformed about how Medicare rules operate. The different reimbursement rates have to do with follow-up in-home care, not the original hospital stay. And crucially, the controversy over reimbursement for patients under \"\"observation care\"\" has nothing whatsoever to do with President Barack Obama’s health care law, the Affordable Care Act. What is ‘observation care’? According to Kaiser Health News, \"\"hospitals provide observation care for patients who are not well enough to go home but not sick enough to be admitted. This care requires a doctor’s order and is considered an outpatient service, even though patients may stay as long as several days. The hospitalization can include short-term treatment and tests to help doctors decide whether the patient should be admitted.\"\" Because observation care is considered outpatient treatment, Medicare generally covers such visits, minus things like copayments and the cost of routine drugs. Where Medicare reimbursement significantly falls short is once an observation patient leaves the hospital. \"\"Observation patients cannot receive Medicare coverage for follow-up care in a nursing home, even though their doctors recommend it,\"\" according to Kaiser. \"\"To be eligible for nursing home coverage, seniors must have first spent at least three consecutive days (or through three midnights) as an admitted patient, not counting the day of discharge.\"\" In other words, assuming the email author’s story actually happened, he shouldn’t have had to worry about Medicare paying for his time in the hospital while under observation. Medicare would have paid, minus copayments and the like; there was no need for him to go home while in a fragile state just to avoid being responsible for the full cost of his care. Is this related to the Affordable Care Act? Tying this policy to Obama’s law is flat-out wrong. \"\"The Affordable Care Act has nothing to do with observation status,\"\" said Mary T. (Terry) Berthelot, a senior attorney with the Center for Medicare Advocacy. Several other health-policy experts confirmed that. The policy was established by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a division of the Department of Health and Human Services. While we’re at it, we’ll take a moment to debunk an additional Affordable Care Act-related claim included in the email. The author writes that during a visit to his family practitioner, \"\"I told him that I had heard that the Affordable Care Act would no longer pay for cancer treatment for those 76 and older, is that true? His understanding is that it is true.\"\" In reality, there are no such age limits. In October 2014, we rated  a chain email that claimed that under the Affordable Care Act, \"\"at age 76 when you most need it most, you are not eligible for cancer treatment. …  Cancer hospital will ration care according to the patient's age.\"\" Our ruling The chain email said that \"\"under the Affordable Care Act, anyone on Medicare who is admitted to a hospital for observation will be responsible for the bill. Medicare won't pay a cent.\"\" That’s wrong. Medicare will cover the hospital stay, minus standard copayments and the like. Patients kept in the hospital under observation will not be able to receive Medicare reimbursements for follow-up care such as nursing-home stays, however. Even more inaccurate is the charge that this policy stemmed from the Affordable Care Act. In reality, this stems from a separate policy decision and had nothing to do with Obama’s law. The claim is not only ridiculous but also dangerous, by urging ailing patients to leave the hospital for no good reason. This claim rates .\"",

        "claim": "\"Ed Schultz said Alan Grayson is \"\"what it's all about.\"",
        "date_published": "September 16, 2010",
        "explanation": "Was MSNBC's Ed Schultz talking about Alan Grayson in Grayson's flashy new ad?",
        "fact_checkers": "Aaron Sharockman",
        "main_text": "\"With friends like Oliver Stone, it's no surprise Alan Grayson is blitzing Central Florida airwaves with glitzy, Hollywood-style campaign ads. Grayson, a Democrat considered vulnerable in his re-election campaign against former Florida House Speaker Dan Webster, is airing a series of ads called \"\"When They Lie.\"\" The couple of ads we've seen are slightly different, but all follow a simple pattern. The screen flashes black and white images of conservative figures like Bill O'Reilly, Rush Limbaugh and Anne Coulter. Then, MSNBC's Ed Schultz, looks directly into the camera and shouts, \"\"This guy is what it's all about.\"\" Next the movie action music ramps up along with images from around the world, mixing in messages in black and white, like \"\"Vote Truth,\"\" \"\"Vote Grayson,\"\" or \"\"When They Lie,\"\" \"\"Vote Grayson.\"\" The ads certainly are different, but we wanted to check the one real line included, the quote from liberal commentator Ed Schultz. Viewers have been tricked before by splicing together snippets of television, and in this case, the rest of the images in the ad have almost nothing directly to do with Grayson. So we wondered if the impression the ad leaves -- that Schultz is talking specifically about Grayson -- matches reality. Grayson, whom Democrats love because he's so blunt and Republicans hate because he's so blunt, took to the House floor Sept. 29, 2009, to detail what he called the Republicans' plan for health care. \"\"The Republicans' health care plan for America ... don't get sick,\"\" Grayson said, with a simple white poster board proclaiming the same message. \"\"That's what the Republicans have in mind for you, America.\"\" But, Grayson added, Republicans recognize that plan isn't foolproof and said the GOP had a backup plan. \"\"If you get sick, America, the Republican health care plan is die quickly,\"\" Grayson added. \"\"The Republicans want you to die quickly if you get sick.\"\" Conservative Republicans demanded an apology for the \"\"die quickly\"\" comment while liberal Democrats praised Grayson. Among the chorus of praise: Schultz, one the country's more prominent liberal pundits. On his Oct. 1, 2009, MSNBC show, Schultz interviewed Grayson about his comments and referred to Grayson as the \"\"new lefty hero on the block.\"\" Here's one exchange between the two, according to an transcript:  Schultz: Congressman, do you take anything back? I mean, are we going to see more of this? Grayson: Absolutely not. The people who should be apologizing are the Republicans. They're the ones who should apologize for dragging us all through the mud here while we're just trying to improve health care in America. That's all we're trying to do. Schultz: Now, the thing I liked about it is that you had charts. I mean, this was planned out. You must have known that this was going to kick up a lot of dust. Did you fire and fire for effect? Grayson: Listen, Ed, we've got to get past this point where everything is stalled, where the Republicans are winning just through inertia. We have a majority. We have to use it. We have to change America. That's the promise that President Obama made. We have to keep it. After nearly an eight-minute interview, Schultz wraps the segment up with his own take on Grayson, and the political impact of his comments. \"\"For all of the hooey and the prognostication that's going on out there about the midterms -- 'Oh, Grayson's doing this, he might hurt the Democrats in the midterms' -- the hell with that,\"\" Schultz said (about 7:55 in). \"\"This guy is what it's all about.\"\" The end of the full quote is the line in the Grayson ad -- Schultz is specifically talking about Grayson. For the record, Grayson did apologize for his comments. Sarcastically. Here was part of that apology. (Video here.) \"\"Well, I would like to apologize. I would like to apologize to the dead, and here's why. According to this study, 'Health Insurance and Mortality in U.S. Adults,' which was published two weeks ago, 44,789 Americans die every year because they have no health insurance. So I call upon the Democratic members of the House. I call upon the Republican members of the House. I call upon all of us to do our jobs for the sake of America, for the sake of those dying people and their families. I apologize to the dead and their families that we haven't voted sooner to end this holocaust in America.\"\" In his new Hollywood-style ad, Grayson uses a quote from a charged-up Schultz that suggests Grayson is \"\"what it's all about.\"\" Grayson clips the full quote -- and omits the suggestion that some think Grayson's antics could hurt Democrats in the 2010 elections -- but Schultz is indeed talking about Grayson, according to transcript and video.\"",

He says I'm too good for him and sometime it'll occur to me that I've been fooling myself into thinking he's a good person worth caring about. He says if he was going to be with anyone, it would be me, but it's never going to happen, so I should be thinking about my future with other guys. Then other times he kisses my nose and tells me I'm pretty. I couldn't accuse him of sending me mixed signals because he'd never mean to be cruel. It makes it hard to kill the hope. \n\nIt's hard to communicate how I feel about this situation and I can't talk to any of my (our) friends about it so I guess I'm just dumping this here to vent a little. I'm tired and frustrated of loving a man who loves me back, and having to acknowledge every single day that that just isn't enough all the time. Feels like it should be. Thanks a lot for reading.\n\nTL;DR:",

        "date_published": "",
        "explanation": "An experimental drug is showing promise against an untreatable eye disease that blinds older adults — and intriguingly, it seems to work in patients who carry a particular gene flaw that fuels the damage to their vision.",
        "fact_checkers": " Lauran Neergaard",
        "main_text": "Age-related macular degeneration, or AMD, is the leading cause of vision loss among seniors, gradually eroding crucial central vision. There are different forms but more than 5 million people worldwide, and a million in the U.S., have an advanced type of so-called “dry” macular degeneration that has no treatment. First patients may notice blurriness when they look straight ahead. Eventually many develop blank spots, becoming legally blind. “These are seniors who are entering their golden years and now they’ve lost the ability to read, watch television, see their loved ones,” said Dr. Rahul Khurana, a retina specialist and spokesman for the American Academy of Ophthalmology. The experimental drug, lampalizumab, aims to slow the destruction of light-sensing cells in the retina, creeping lesions that characterize the stage of dry AMD called “geographic atrophy.” When those cells die, they can’t grow back — the vision loss is irreversible. WHAT THE RESEARCH FOUND In an 18-month study of 129 patients, monthly eye injections of the drug modestly slowed worsening of the disease when compared with patients given dummy shots. What’s exciting for scientists came next, when researchers from drugmaker Genentech Inc. took a closer look at exactly who was being helped. It turns out that nearly 6 in 10 of the study’s participants carry a gene variation that makes part of the immune system go awry — a genetic flaw already known to increase the risk of getting macular degeneration in the first place. Those are the only patients who appeared to benefit from the drug; they had 44 percent less eye damage than the untreated patients, the Genentech team reported Wednesday in the journal Science Translational Medicine. While the study is too small to prove if lampalizumab really helps maintain vision, that’s a bigger difference than the overall results suggested. WHY WOULD AN IMMUNE-RELATED GENE AFFECT AGING EYES? One arm of the immune system, the complement pathway, helps fight infections by attracting immune cells to attack bacteria. Normally, there’s a barrier that keeps such cells away from the retina. But that barrier can break down with age, opening sensitive eye cells to harm from the spillover, explained Genentech immunologist Menno van Lookeren Campagne. Now for the gene connection: Previous studies have linked macular degeneration to gene variations that remove some of that pathway’s natural brakes, so it can become too active. The hypothesis: Genentech’s drug, lampalizumab, essentially offers a backup method for tamping down the immune reaction. An antibody, it works by inhibiting a particular enzyme named factor D that helps power the immune pathway. “We try to reinsert the braking ability,” said study lead author Brian Yaspan, a Genentech senior scientist. WHAT’S NEXT Wednesday’s study detected no safety concerns, clearing the way for Genentech and its parent company Roche to open two large-scale studies that aim to prove if the drug works. Results are expected later this year. The current research sheds light on how that long-suspected immune culprit might be working, and is “the first suggestion that there may be a treatment for geographic atrophy coming up in the future,” said National Eye Institute retina specialist Dr. Wai Wong, who wasn’t involved in the study. “It’s a very, very exciting study,” said Khurana, the ophthalmologist association’s spokesman, who also wasn’t part of the research. “From the basic science perspective, it makes a lot of sense.” HEALTH ADVICE FOR NOW Macular degeneration tends to occur after age 60, but it sometimes strikes earlier. According to the National Eye Institute, it’s less common in people who exercise regularly, avoid smoking, and eat a diet high in green leafy vegetables and fish. Symptoms often aren’t noticeable early on. But several eye tests can detect signs of macular degeneration, including a dilated eye exam and a tool called an Amsler grid with straight lines that may look wavy if the macula, the center of the retina, is harmed. Macular degeneration patients often are advised to take certain vitamin combinations that may help stave off advanced disease. And it’s important for patients to know what type they have. While there’s no treatment for the advanced dry form, the “wet” form occurs when leaky blood vessels grow under the retina — and there are several therapies that can help those patients preserve vision. ___ This Associated Press series was produced in partnership with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

        "explanation": "\"This was a story about how some doctors are taking a new look at anesthesia, the consequences associated with its use, and possible options for minimizing anesthesia exposure. The story pointed out that anesthesia use is an important addition to medical care, but that there are certain possible risks that merit further evaluation. The story was somewhat alarmist, citing 'suggestions' that anestheisa might weaken the body's ability to kill tumor cells  thereby making cancer recurrence more likely or that it might trigger an inflammatory response leading to atherosclerosis and other serious conditions. Mostly animal studies are cited to raise alarm about anesthesia. There are relevant human studies and they should have cited those and the rates of adverse effects. Although one of the anesthesiologists interviewed for this story talked about 'increasing evidence', the story itself did not contain evidence or even traceable references to evidence on the topic. Instead, it quoted a number of experts about their 'suggestions', 'fears', and 'hopes' when it comes to the effects that anesthesia had on function. While the story did mention rats taking longer to run a maze as adults when subjected to prolonged anesthesia when young, there was no quantitative estimate for the size of the effect anesthesia had been demonstrated to play. Even when data were given (1998 Lancet study showing 10% of elderly surgery patients have worse scores on cognition tests post surgery) we get no information on the magnitude of the effect (is it clinically important?) or on the research design (and therefore, the likely validity of any findings). There were clear attempts to inject balance into the story. The story stated, \"\"Many clinical anesthesiologists question the relevance of the animal studies.\"\" One source said, \"\"Human babies are not large rat pups.\"\" It is also stated, \"\"Most anesthesiologists and surgeons, citing the millions of people the world over who live long, healthy lives after surgery, say there is no call for worry.\"\"\"",

        "main_text": "\"There was no discussion of costs but we acknowledge that costs would be difficult to discuss in this story. They might have discussed the comparative costs of general vs. spinal vs. regional anesthesia or the potential downstream costs of anesthesia adverse effects. The benefits associated with the use of anesthesia were not presented other than the introduction explaining that anesthesia allows a patient to 'wake……as if from a deep slumber' having made it possible for surgery to take place. However there was no quantification of benefit from anesthesia in terms of how surgical risks are decreased in an anesthetized as opposed to unanesthetized patient. The story could also have addressed the comparative benefits between different forms of anesthesia. Possible harms associated with anesthesia were discussed in the article, though there was no information about how often these harms occur or how severe the effects might be. There were clear attempts to balance the information.

Although outlining reasons why anesthesia might present some increased risk of bodily harm, the story did not provide any guidance for determining whether a patient has any options in regards to anesthesia type, dose, and duration or anything about categories of procedures where options were more likely. Various anesthesia options were mentioned (regional/spinal/local) as was the fact that studies are underway to test hypotheses about particular advantages. However, the story didn't discuss any of the known advantages/disadvantages of these alternatives. The use of anesthesia is widely utilized in the surgical management of medical conditions, which is clear in the story. The story was clear that anesthesia is not new but explained that what is a more recent wrinkle is a focused examination of the long term impact of exposure to anesthesia Does not appear to rely on a press release.\"",

        "main_text": "Cancer patients increasingly are having their care guided by gene tumor boards, a new version of the hospital panels that traditionally decided whether surgery, radiation or chemotherapy would be best. These experts study the patient’s cancer genes and match treatments to mutations that seem to drive the disease. “We dissect the patient’s tumor with what I call the molecular microscope,” said Dr. Razelle Kurzrock, who started a board at the University of California, San Diego, where Cairnes is treated. It’s the kind of care many experts say we should aim for — precision medicine, the right drug for the right person at the right time, guided by genes. There are success stories, but also some failures and many questions: Will gene-guided care improve survival? Does it save money or cost more? What kind of gene testing is best, and who should get it? “I think every patient needs it,” especially if cancer is advanced, said Kurzrock, who consults for some gene-medicine companies. “Most people don’t agree with me — yet. In five years, it may be malpractice not to do genomics.” Few people get precision medicine today, said Dr. Eric Topol, head of the Scripps Translational Science Institute. “The only thing that’s gone mainstream are the words.” HOW IT WORKS NOW If you have a cancer that might be susceptible to a gene-targeting drug, you may be tested for mutations in that gene, such as HER2 for breast cancer. Some breast or prostate cancer patients also might get a multi-gene test to gauge how aggressive treatment should be. Then most patients get usual guideline-based treatments. If there’s no clear choice, or if the disease has spread or comes back, doctors may suggest tumor profiling — comprehensive tests to see what mutations dominate. That’s traditionally been done from a tissue sample, but newer tests that detect tumor DNA in blood — liquid biopsies — are making profiling more common. The tests cost about $6,000 and many insurers consider them experimental and won’t pay. Gene tumor boards analyze what the results suggest about treatment. They focus on oddball cases like a breast cancer mutation in a colon cancer patient, or cancers that have widely spread and are genetically complex. The only options may be experimental drugs or “off-label” treatments — medicines approved for different situations. But as tumor profiling grows, it’s revealing how genetically diverse many tumors are, and that oddball cases are not so rare, said Dr. John Marshall. He heads the virtual tumor board at Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center that also serves cancer centers in Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Michigan and Tennessee. “There is a little bit of faith” that testing will show the right treatment, but it’s not a sure thing, said Dr. Lee Schwartzberg, who heads one participating center, the West Cancer Center in Memphis. Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, the American Cancer Society’s deputy chief medical officer, is optimistic yet wary. Drugs that target BRAF mutations work well for skin cancers called melanomas, but less well for lung or colon cancers. “Just because a mutation occurs it doesn’t mean that drug is going to work in that cancer,” he said. LUCKY CASES When it does, results can be dramatic. Cairnes’ cancer was between her stomach and esophagus, and had spread to her liver, lungs and lymph nodes. Tissue testing found 10 abnormal genes, but on the liquid biopsy only EGFR popped out as a good target. Two drugs aim at that gene but aren’t approved for her type of cancer. A tumor board advised trying both — Erbitux and Tarceva, the drug her husband also had taken. Within two weeks, she quit using pain medicines. After two months, her liver tumor had shrunk roughly by half. There are signs that cancer may remain, but it is under control. She feels well enough to travel and to take care of her granddaughter. “I’m very, very grateful to have a targeted therapy,” Cairnes said. “I cannot expect a better outcome than what we’re seeing right now,” said her doctor, Shumei Kato. WHAT STUDIES SHOW But is gene-guided treatment better than usual care? French doctors did the first big test, with disappointing results. About 200 patients with advanced cancer were given whatever their doctors thought best or off-label drugs based on tumor profiling. Survival was similar — about two months. Another French study, reported in June, was slightly more encouraging on survival but exposed another problem: No drugs exist for many gene flaws. Tests found treatable mutations in half of the 2,000 participants and only 143 got what a tumor board suggested. Some doctors worry that tumor boards’ recommending off-label treatments diverts patients from research that would benefit all cancer patients. For example, the American Society of Clinical Oncology’s TAPUR study tests off-label drugs and shares results with their makers and federal regulators. LETTING PATIENTS CHOOSE Ann Meffert, who lives on a dairy farm in Waunakee, Wisconsin, endured multiple standard treatments that didn’t defeat her bile duct cancer. “She was going to be referred to hospice; there was not much we could do,” said Dr. Nataliya Uboha, who took the case to a tumor board at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The panel gave several options, including off-label treatment, and Meffert chose a study that matches patients to gene-targeting therapies and started on an experimental one last October. “Two weeks in, I started feeling better,” she said, and when she saw test results, “I couldn’t believe the difference.” Many lung spots disappeared and the liver tumor shrank 75 percent. She is not cured, though, and doctors are thinking about next steps. And that could involve a fresh look at her tumor genes. ___ Marilynn Marchione can be followed at @MMarchioneAP __ This Associated Press series was produced in partnership with the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Department of Science Education.

        "date_published": "June 18, 2014",
        "explanation": "The world’s top food and drink companies announced a raft of measures on Wednesday to try to improve the industry’s image, including stopping advertising junk food to children by 2018, harmonizing nutritional labeling and fighting deforestation.",
        "fact_checkers": " ",
        "main_text": "The Consumer Goods Forum (CGF), an industry network of some 400 retailers, manufacturers and other players from 70 countries with combined sales of 2.5 trillion euros ($3.4 trillion), agreed the commitments at its annual summit in Paris. “It is not business as usual anymore. Pressure is mounting from all sides and angles,” Paul Bulcke, chief executive of Nestle, the world’s biggest food and drink firm behind brands such as Kit-Kat and Nescafe, told the meeting. “We need to show them we are a responsive and responsible industry, now more than ever.”  Food manufacturers and retailers have come under mounting pressure in recent years over their role in a range of issues from the global obesity epidemic, to climate change and deforestation due to the growth of palm oil production. The steps announced on Wednesday included a commitment to     stop targeting advertising to children under 12 years by 2018 of products that fail to meet certain nutrition criteria and to introduce industry-wide labeling by 2018 to help consumers make healthier food choices. Bulcke said the CGF board also agreed that members would make company policies on nutrition and product formulation public by 2016. The CGF promised its members would aim for zero net deforestation by 2020 through the more sustainable sourcing of key commodities and begin phasing out hydro fluorocarbons, blamed for contributing to global warming, in new refrigeration units by 2015. In 2011, top U.S. food and drink makers including Coca-Cola and Kellogg Co agreed to industry-created voluntary nutrition guidelines for products marketed towards children under the age of 12. But the food, beverage and restaurant industries as a whole have successfully fought most government oversight on food advertising to children. In October 2013, U.S. legislation was proposed that would require uniform front-of-package food labels in a move to streamline labels and clarify certain claims on nutrition. In Europe, regulations that go into effect in December 2014 change existing legislation on food labeling that would require nutrition information on processed foods, origin labeling of unprocessed meat, the highlighting of allergens such as peanuts and better legibility.

        "claim": "Gene therapy for rare bleeding disorder achieves proof-of-concept",
        "date_published": "January 28, 2016",
        "explanation": "Credit: UC Davis Comparative Oncology ProgramThis short news release describes a gene therapy experiment in four dogs that might turn out to help human patients with a rare blood disorder known as Factor VII deficiency. The release does a good job of making clear that this is just a proof-of-concept and needs human trials. Great specific language is used to make that clear. But it does not give any context for the problems of developing gene therapies for rare diseases. Companies may balk at developing a treatment than can’t be sold very widely, which contributes to high costs. Gene therapies are emotional minefields for patients and families, especially since so much has been promised and actual successes have been few. One gene therapy offered in Europe has a price tag of $1 million. This release would serve readers better if it gave some of that daunting context. A Washington Post story explains some of the challenges: “No [gene] therapy is approved yet in the United States, so discussions about price — as well as crucial questions about how much patients will pay directly — are hypothetical. But industry leaders are already talking about ways to get ahead of potentially massive one-time price tags that could make insurers and patients balk.”",
        "fact_checkers": "Sally James,Susan Wei, PhD,Kathlyn Stone",
        "main_text": "The news release does not bring up costs, but we’ll rate this Not Applicable since the release is clear that this is early-stage work that is not yet ready for use in humans. Some mention of costs would have been valuable nonetheless. Gene therapy is known to be extremely costly, and when a disease is rare, as this is, that raises questions about what company would find it profitable to pursue the potential treatment. The University of Utah provides some excellent background on the “commercial viability” of gene therapy. The release squeaks by on this. There are no numbers used to quantify, but this excerpt at least touches on the method of measurement and the three-year follow up. “The treated dogs had expressed levels of clotting factor VII that would be therapeutic in humans, with long-term stability. In one dog, the effects persisted nearly three years.”  The release could have explained what a “therapeutic” expression level of clotting factor actually means. A closer look at the paper reveals that a clinically therapeutic level is greater than or equal to 15% of normal. The release addresses harms in a couple of places, as in this excerpt: “The FVII-deficient dogs tolerated the initial gene therapy infusions very well and have had no adverse side effects over several years of follow up.” and in a quote by the lead researcher: “Based on kidney function, liver function, and blood measurements in the dogs, the treatment was safe, and did not elicit unwanted immune responses.” But as this study was done in canines, we would have liked a bit more detail on how harms might  manifest in human clinical trials. The limited information given in the news release describes the quality of the evidence, particularly the fact that this was an animal study that is not directly applicable to humans. The release notes that the study “sets the stage for clinical trials in humans.” The release could have noted that a study with only four (canine) participants is very small. There is no disease mongering. There were no conflicts identified. All the funding sources were listed. The release tells us that this rare clotting disorder is currently treated by infusions of clotting factors. The release could have done a better job of explaining how difficult that therapy is for patients. Is the disorder regulated well by that method? We aren’t given any information or what those costs are vs. what a one-time gene therapy might cost. The release makes clear that this treatment will not be available until human clinical trials are conducted. This gene therapy is novel for this particular condition. The news release should also be commended for pointing out that a similar gene therapy approach has been tested by the same researchers for hemophilia. It’s admirable that they are not overselling the novelty of this approach by referencing their own previous work in related areas. We were pleased to see proof-of-concept in the headline, because this is a very useful way to immediately alert readers that an idea has been validated, but not a therapy for human patients.",

        "main_text": "\"Although this is a very preliminary study, some mention of costs should have been included, even if simply to note that the cost of potential treatments is unknown at the present time. The published study itself does not quantify benefits clearly , perhaps understandable given that it is a laboratory study, not a clinical one. But we give the story a satisfactory rating for doing a reasonable job of putting the study results into context. The brevity of the response and the inconsistent findings across individuals were noted appropriately in the story. While harms are not quantified in the published study itself, this story does well to emphaszie the importance — and current lack — of safety data for an alluded-to use of oxytocin in children with autism. We do know a good deal about the toxicity of oxytocin when given to women to induce labor and for a few hours. In addititon to possible severe allergic reactions, water intoxication is an important side effect. We give the story kudos for noting several limitations in this research, including the wide variations in individual responses and a lack of evidence that the strategy \"\"would be effective at all\"\" in children or young adults. The author also notes a lack of long-term safety data, and she describes  challenges in translating the delivery method to a real-world application. We would have liked to have seen a bit more characterization of the preliminary nature of this laboratory study and its very small sample. The story does not resort to disease-mongering. The story cites several independent sources and provides several quotes for balance. The study authors themselves identified no conflicts of interest. The story does discuss the treatment of autism and that no drug therapies are currently available for the social dysfunction observed in people with Asperger syndrome and other forms of autism. The story is clear that the strategy used in this laboratory study is uNPRoven in the real world, particularly in children and young adults. They even note the issues in translating the delivery method to clinical practice. The article notes that there have been prior studies that also demonstrated an effect of oxytocin in people with autism. The story does not appear to rely on a news release.\"",

        "claim": "FDA approves new eczema drug Dupixent",
        "date_published": "April 4, 2017",
        "explanation": "This news release from the FDA announces the agency’s approval of a new drug, dupilumab (to be marketed as Dupixent), for treating eczema, or atopic dermatitis. It briefly describes the type of clinical trials leading to the approval and identifies the possible harms that might arise from use of this injectable drug. It omits, however, any measurements showing how effective the drug is, referring to benefits only in general terms. Some estimates suggest as many as 18 million Americans suffer from moderate-to-severe eczema — and for them it is a miserable disease. A new medication that is potentially effective against this condition would therefore be welcomed. But the enormous cost of this drug, similar to others aimed at thwarting eczema, might play a major role in patient access to the treatment.",
        "fact_checkers": "Earle Holland,Doug Campos-Outcalt, MD, MPA,Kathlyn Stone",
        "main_text": "The FDA evaluates drugs without considering costs, which is why they are not discussed in this news release. We hope the FDA will also begin commenting on the projected cost of a drug and its cost-effectiveness. In this case, costs are very steep. An NBC.com story on the approval which we also reviewed, predicts the drug will cost $37,000 annually. It’s unknown if Dupixent will be covered by health insurance. In terms of benefits, the release offers the following: “Overall, participants who received Dupixent achieved greater response, defined as clear or almost clear skin, and experienced a reduction in itch after 16 weeks of treatment.” But readers are left to interpret on their own what “greater response” and “a reduction in itch” mean. The release would have been better if it had told readers how the improvement was measured and how many patients experienced improvement rather than using the term “overall.” The release gets an acceptable rating in this category since it mentions that the drug can cause serious allergic reactions and eye problems including conjunctivitis (pinkeye) and keratitis (inflammation of the cornea). It also cautions that people with asthma shouldn’t use the drug since it hasn’t been tested for safety in these patients. The release should also have noted that regulators don’t know if there are any long-term harms associated with Dupixent use. None of the trials exceeded 16 weeks. The release describes who was studied and for how long, and offers a bare-bones description of the types of studies: “The safety and efficacy of Dupixent were established in three placebo-controlled clinical trials with a total of 2,119 adult participants with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis not adequately controlled by topical medication(s).” The FDA doesn’t provide a link to the studies or their titles and where they were published. The release would be more complete had that information been included. It would help journalists and people with eczema and would be a significant improvement to FDA releases. The release does not engage in disease-mongering. Instead it offers a clear description of what eczema is and what causes the condition. There is no mention of who funded the research leading to the FDA approval, although many readers will assume it was supported by the manufacturer Regeneron. The release gets a borderline satisfactory for mentioning topical corticosteroids as an alternative treatment for eczema but neglects to mention that other pharmaceuticals are also now available for treating it. Whether or not this medication will be covered by insurance is a huge concern. Its high cost will affect how many people can access this new drug. Its availability should have been addressed in the release. It’s newsworthy whenever the FDA approves a new drug. This appears to be the first biologic, injectable treatment for eczema. The release does not use any unjustifiable language.",

Prevention efforts focus on hand hygiene to reduce transmission. Large doses of vitamin C, echinacea and, more recently, zinc, have become increasingly popular judged by the number and variety of products that are now available. However, there is little evidence to support their use. This story reports on a recent review of the available literature on the evidence that zinc improves the outcomes in individuals with colds. The story does an excellent job of laying out the problem, describing the new information available from the literature review, and putting it into context for the reader. The story does a good job of describing how many studies showed no effect of the zinc products. In the one study showing a benefit of zinc nasal gel, the story provides quantification of benefits in natural frequencies (days of duration of the cold) rather than in terms of relative reduction. The story does a great job of describing the design of the current study, which is a special kind of literature review and quotes an independent expert as well as the lead author on the current study and the representative of the manufacturer. Overall, this was a very well-written story, free of hype and full of helpful information.",

        "main_text": "In April 2016, multiple Facebook pages shared links to articles with titles claiming an “abortionist strangled [a] baby” following a botched abortion. The tendency of social media users to share items without clicking through to the content led many to believe that the link described a current event. Most of these links led to a 9 May 2013 LifeSiteNews article, which was three years old at the time of its April 2016 Facebook circulation. Nearly all versions included the same exact photograph of what appeared to be a full-term infant crying, an image dated to 2014, was in no way related to abortion, and depicted a healthy baby boy, Karson Hanson. How Karson’s photograph came to be linked to the story wasn’t clear. Even the 2013 article didn’t describe anything recent. The events described were from 2 March 1977, and involved a saline abortion that reportedly resulted in a live birth: In 1977, abortion was legal throughout the country during all nine months of pregnancy. When an obstetrician/gynecologist told teenager “Mary W” that she was 28 weeks pregnant, he suggested that she give the baby up for adoption, as few doctors in the area were willing to perform abortions that late. But Mary was determined, and she managed to find an abortionist – Dr. William Baxter Waddill. On March 2, 1977, Mary arrived at Westminster Community Hospital for a saline abortion. Saline abortions are seldom performed today because of the danger to the mother and the possibility of live births, but in the 1970s and ’80s, they were very common. They were generally used to end pregnancies towards the end of the second trimester … The abortionist injected the saline and then left, leaving the nurses to tend to Mary. It was common for abortion doctors to inject their patients with saline and then leave, forcing the nurses to bear the emotional brunt of the abortion procedures and to dispose of the dead babies. In this case, however, Mary gave birth to a living 2-lb., 8-oz. baby girl. The story goes on to describe the doctor arriving at the clinic, angrily chasing chased all the nurses out of the room and making a call to another physician, Dr. Ronald Cornelson. (At that time, two doctors needed to be present to pronounce a premature baby dead.) The article presented many of its claims in a first-person, eyewitness style of reporting. Towards the end, it cited a separate anti-abortion blog as a source for its claims, saying the baby could have lived: Could the little girl have survived if she had not been strangled? In the 1970s, neonatology was not as advanced as it is today. In the 1990s, over 90% of babies born at 27 weeks were able to survive. The number is even higher now. Statistics from the 1970s are harder to come by, but an article in The Sydney Morning Herald claims that these babies had about a 71% survival rate if given medical attention promptly. So it is possible – if not very likely – that the baby would have survived if she had continued to be treated in the ICU. The November 2006 blog post from which the article was sourced made no effort to clarify how information about the failed 1977 saline abortion was obtained (such as medical records, court documents, or individual accounts). Most mentions of the case were versions of the same original blog post written in 2006, citations for which were either too vague to lend clarification or long-since dead. Very little accessible material remained,  including details of what was an eventual criminal case against Waddill; a summary was published by the Orange County Register in 2009: Dr. William Waddill, a prominent Huntington Harbour obstetrician, was charged with strangling a fetus delivered after an unsuccessful abortion on an 18-year-old high school student. The frightened young woman had to push her way through throngs of protesters and glaring camera lights outside the Santa Ana courthouse to testify against Waddill in two headline-making trials that focused public attention on the abortion debate raging across the country. Twice, Waddill was tried on murder charges. Twice, the jury deadlocked. Orange County Judge Byron K. McMillan ultimately dismissed the case against Waddill in 1979 after the second hung jury. The trials pertained to complications that arose during a long-retired procedure known as a saline abortion. It bears mentioning that none of the details of the 1977 incident were relevant to the discussion of abortion in 2016, as saline abortions fell out of favor in the 1970s (and along with them, complications that could lead to a surviving fetus). Without this relevant context, readers were left with an impression that such an outcome was likely (or even possible) in 2016, which was misleading at best. A 6 April 1979 editorial in the Chicago Tribune weighed in on the merits of the case, and several local newspapers covered two trials associated with the failed abortion. The most detailed accounting came from a February 1993 article in the Los Angeles Times. That article (itself published more than a decade after the trial) indicated that crucial details such as the fetus’ developmental stage and ultimate cause of death were never determined: Waddill, a successful Huntington Harbour obstetrician, was accused of strangling to death a baby who had survived the abortion he had performed on the 18-year-old. He eventually was tried twice for murder, but never convicted in connection with the baby’s death … Neither jury in the Waddill trials could reach a unanimous decision and the charge was finally dismissed after the second jury in 1979 voted 11 to 1 for acquittal … Aside from the allegations that Waddill strangled the infant, the prosecution contended that the doctor failed to try to save the baby and could be convicted for that alone. The Waddill case began the morning of March 2, 1977, when Mary Weaver, an unwed Huntington Beach teen-ager and daughter of an area high school principal, underwent a saline abortion at Westminster Community Hospital, which no longer exists … About 10 that night, the baby–estimated to be anywhere from 20 weeks to 30 weeks old–was born alive. When Waddill arrived at the hospital and viewed the baby in the nursery, he would later testify, “The abortus looked absolutely lifeless . . . for all intents and purposes, dead.” Later, he said he did see the infant make some gasps. But he insisted they were associated with the baby going through the final throes of death. He still believed the infant had no hope for survival after being bathed for hours in the deadly saline solution. Waddill then ordered everyone out of the nursery, except for pediatrician Ronald J. Cornelson. What happened next to the baby has ultimately come down to Cornelson’s word against Waddill’s. According to Waddill, the baby died from the massive exposure to the saline solution. But a few days after the incident, Cornelson told police that he had watched in horror as Waddill tried three times to strangle the infant before it finally succeeded on the fourth attempt. Experts differed on whether the baby was even alive outside the womb and its age. Even the prosecution’s experts acknowledged that the baby could not have lived for any real length of time. Reports from February 1978 attributed the claims of strangulation and a version of the quoted remarks to the attending pediatrician’s testimony, and the trial by all accounts was a function of lack of medical protocol: The later popular focus of the incident (Waddill’s purported strangulation of the fetus) came not from forensic evidence, but testimony: The decades-old incident was ideal for purposes of editorializing precisely because so much time had passed, leaving details obfuscated and difficult to check. Social media users exposed to the item in 2016 could easily be led to believe that the story was recent; not only was the item circulating at that time published in 2013, it was sourced from a 2006 blog post. Even then, nearly 30 years had passed between the failed saline abortion and the story’s emergence on anti-abortion blogs. It’s true that an obstetrician-gynecologist named Dr. William Waddill performed an unsuccessful saline abortion on a young patient on 2 March 1977. It’s also true that the abortion may have failed due to a later gestational age than anticipated. A witness and fellow doctor testified that Waddill strangled the dying fetus; Waddill maintained he was checking for a pulse. Even those condemning the doctor conceded that there was virtually no chance the fetus would have survived had care been rendered. The doctor was twice tried over the infant’s death, but was found not guilty, and later resumed his practice. However, the circumstances under which that abortion went terribly wrong have long since been made exceedingly unlikely due to advances in medicine. Saline abortions were almost never used after the 1970s (due to risk to the mother), and today, updated diagnostic devices ensure that both patients and doctors receive a much better idea of how advanced a pregnancy is before proceeding with its termination.",

However the research itself did not involve individuals with Alzheimer’s disease, nor did it study individuals over time to establish whether the technique could be used to predict changes that occur for a given individual. The story provided only the best case scenario for the value of this technique while acknowledging that ‘a good clinical evaluation’ is still the best tool available. For individuals concerned about development about Alzheimer’s disease, this article is overly enthusiastic about the promise of this scan for enhancing the ability to detect Alzheimer’s disease.",
        "fact_checkers": " ",
        "main_text": "\"There was no discussion about direct costs for this test. The story always qualified any potential benefit as possibility by qualifying every claim with the term ‘may’. It would have improved this piece to include an explicit statement that there is currently no way to quantify what the benefit of early detection might be. The story did not mention that 13% of the individuals in the study were unable to complete the test due to claustrophobia and that for 17% of the individuals tested, there were technical difficulties which made their test results unusable. Although it was good that the story qualified every claim made for this new method of assessment with the term \"\"may\"\" ( as in ‘may prove useful’), it did not mention that the study merely assessed a group of individuals at a single time point and found that this test correlated with some verbal tests of memory. Because it is not possible to determine whether what appears to be age-related differences may relate to other ways in which the tested individuals differ, it is premature to conclude that this test will be found to successfully distinguish between those who will and will not develop Alzheimer’s Disease. In fact, since individuals with cognitive impairment were from excluded from the study, the study did not provide any evidence that the test could actually distinguish between people with and without Alzheimer’s Disease, let alone those who will develop the disease. The story did not engage in overt disease-mongering. The story did include a quote from a neurologist who did not appear to be directly connected with the study. That said, his comments were general in nature and were not explicitly about the research reported on. The story mentioned that the testing procedure reported on ‘shows evidence of being more sensitive’ than other tests, while acknowledging that ‘a good clinical evaluation is still the best tool’. The story provided no insight about whether hospitals have the facilities needed for this test. While the story reported on a most recent study using DTI technology for assessment of Alzheimer’s disease, there is medical literature on this dating back several years, a context the story didn’t provide. We can’t be sure of the extent to which the story was primarily driven by a news release. The story acknowledges that the quote from the lead author of the research came from a news release.\"",

(5) Некоторое время король был влюблён в фрейлину королевы госпожу д’Отфор, что, впрочем, не помешало ему воспользоваться каминными щипцами, чтобы достать записку из-за корсажа этой дамы, так как он боялся дотронуться рукой до её груди. (6) Любовные увлечения короля вообще «были престранными», ибо из всех чувств ему более всего была присуща ревность. (7) Он страшно ревновал госпожу д’Отфор к д’Эгийон-Вассе, хотя та и уверяла его, что он её родственник. (8) И только когда знаток генеалогии д’Озье, зная в чем дело, подтвердил слова придворной красавицы, король поверил ей. (9) С госпожой д’Отфор Людовик часто беседовал «о лошадях, собаках, птицах и других подобных предметах». (10) А надо сказать, что король очень любил охоту. (11) Помимо же охоты он «умел делать кожаные штанины, силки, сети, аркебузы, чеканить монету», выращивал ранний зелёный горошек, изготовлял оконные рамы, отлично брил, а также был неплохим кондитером и садовником.",

The story notes that this reduces stress on a patient’s joints, and refers to a relatively recent study showing possible cardiovascular benefits for stroke patients. The story highlights several reasons why water-based therapy may be appealing (leading to “health experts gushing” over it), but provides no evidence to show that people get better using this therapy, or that it works better than standard physical therapy. And that’s important to discuss, considering the presumed higher price tag and lack of availability compared to standard PT–though the story doesn’t discuss these points, either. For people recovering from an injury or illness requiring physical therapy, water-based therapy may be an appealing alternative. But does it work? Or is it an expensive gimmick? This story doesn’t provide the details needed for readers to get a sense of how effective it is.",
        "fact_checkers": "Matt Shipman,Steven J. Atlas, MD, MPH,Joy Victory",
        "main_text": "Cost is not discussed, which is a significant oversight. At least some idea of what the out-of-pocket costs are for this kind of therapy is important. While we wouldn’t expect the story to necessarily address all the following issues, these are the kinds of questions people have when considering what kind of therapy to receive. First, the treadmill systems: It is difficult for consumers to find a cost for underwater treadmills, as most of the companies that sell them tell potential customers to contact the company for a quote. However, the treadmill company mentioned by name in the article quotes $65,000 in the example on how its leasing program works. And a 2013 story in USA Today says that underwater treadmill systems range in price from $33,000 to $270,000. A 2014 story in Runner’s World says that insurance may cover the use of such a treadmill system at a physical therapist’s office, if the system is being used for injury recovery. The CBS story doesn’t even give us that much information. Second, this story also mentions pools that have a “water flow system you can work against.” Again, it’s not clear what the costs of such a system would be, but one such company notes that its least expensive therapy pool options start at $7,400 (yet, the same company notes that its standard system “starts at $22,900”). Third, the story also refers to simply exercising in a pool with a foam vest or foam handbells. This is, of course, far more affordable for most people. But it’s not clear, at all, how comparable the benefits of this sort of activity are to the use of the high-end systems discussed in the rest of the article. Lastly, for a story like this, it would be great to know how water-based physical therapy compares in cost to standard PT. It may not be covered by a patient’s insurance and result in higher out of pocket costs, for example. The story focuses on multiple benefits, none of which are quantified. For example, the story discusses the ways in which being underwater can reduce joint pain during exercise. How much does it reduce pain? What are the benefits in terms of health outcomes? Unclear. There also was no attempt to quantify speed of recovery and final recovery state compared to other treatments such as standard physical therapy. It also cites a study showing cardiovascular benefits for stroke patients, but it doesn’t even appear that this study directly compared outcomes of water-based PT vs. standard PT in patients following a stroke. Rather, it sounds like the study compared physiologic measures in stroke patients comparing two forms of exercise testing, which isn’t proof that one method resulted in better recovery outcomes for patients. The story doesn’t discuss harms. There don’t appear to be any particular health risks associated with the use of underwater treadmills that wouldn’t apply to beginning any exercise or rehabilitation regime — but that’s actually a point worth making. However, exercising in a pool poses risks of its own — particularly for patients who may be recovering from surgery or stroke. As a result, it would be wise to explain that these patients (or any patient who is not confident in the water) should have supervision. And, this therapy may induce anxiety among people who can’t swim or are anxious around water. The story refers only to a single study, and doesn’t give readers much information on how to find the study it does refer to. It does tell readers where the study was published (though not when), that the study compared on-land treadmill use and underwater treadmill use among stroke survivors, and that the study involved 21 patients. (If you’re curious, we found the relevant study. It’s here.) There was no evidence provided to support the claims of any benefits other than cardiovascular benefits for stroke survivors. No disease mongering here. Though, the story implies that this form of therapy can be used for just about any condition where treadmill or bike treatment is indicated. So not disease mongering, but possibly treatment mongering. The story quotes four experts, making this a strong point. It would have been helpful for one of these experts to point out that there is very little evidence supporting water-based PT compared to standard PT. The alternative to using a treadmill underwater would be to engage in cardiovascular exercise on dry land. The story addresses this, noting both the treadmill comparison study (mentioned above) and the fact that exercising in water reduces stress on joints. So, we’ll give it a Satisfactory rating. However, the story intimates that exercising in a pool and exercising on an underwater treadmill are comparable. It’s not clear that this is the case, and the 2014 story from Runner’s World indicates that they are actually quite different. What’s more, there is no discussion of another form of aquatic exercise: swimming. Is swimming a viable option for cardiovascular recovery? It’s not clear from the story how widely available underwater treadmills are for the general public. Underwater treadmills are not particularly new (the research literature on them goes back to at least 1989). Frankly, it’s not clear why this story was written now, or what is novel about underwater treadmill exercise (given how the story indicates that it is comparable to walking in a pool with a foam vest). The story does not appear to be based on a news release.",

        "date_published": "July 12, 2009",
        "explanation": "\"This story is about a study in which the strongest finding is that treatment with antipsychotics lowers mortality. The differences between drugs is less convincing and the opening statement that \"\"thousands of lives could have been saved\"\" if patients had been prescribed clozapine is simply not explained or justified adequately. There are cardiac and other long-term risks associated with most anti-psychotic medications (including clozapine) and schizophrenics generally have a higher rate of suicide than the general population, so we cannot say how many lives would have been saved with clozapine. The story focuses on clozapine as a viable drug treatment for schizophrenia when other anti-psychotic medication does not work. Use of the drug as a \"\"last resort\"\" may be reconsidered based on new evidence that there is lower long-term mortality risks with this drug compared to other commonly prescribed anti-psychotic medications. However, the story does not mention more common side effects of this drug which may limit tolerability. The story also does not mention that patients taking clozapine are typically monitored frequently (weekly to monthly) for white blood cell counts (loss of white blood cells led to the death of patients taking the drug in the 1970s). This would increase cost, which is also not mentioned. One strength of the story is that it used two independent sources who provide good clinical perspective on the results of this 10-year retrospective study.\"",
        "fact_checkers": " ",
        "main_text": "\"The story does not give the cost of Clozapine nor a cost comparison between it and other anti-psychotic medications. Frequent monitoring and dealing with common side effects increase costs and potential for hospitalization. But even giving the cost of the drug alone is not giving the entire cost picture. Clozapine is usually prescribed from specialized clinics and requires frequent monitoring (weekly for 6 months, then biweekly for 6 months, then ongoing). So there is the cost of the drug and monitoring and dealing with side effects and any effects on health care utilization (e.g. hospitalization for decompensation) vs other regimens. The story does not mention costs for additional monitoring. One problem is that only relative risks are given without any information on baseline risk. It would be much better if the story provided the annual or 10-year risk of dying untreated, with clozapine and with other antipsychotics. This would give the reader a better idea of the potential benefit (lower mortality) vs. harms (rare agranulocytosis, common – constipation etc) and hassles (weekly monitoring initially) and costs (one of the most expensive drugs). The story leads with a statement that \"\"thousands of lives could have been saved\"\" if more schizophrenics were prescribed clozapine instead of no medication or newer anti-psychotics. This is an overstatement and not an entirely correct interpretation of the study. There are cardiac risks associated with most anti-psychotic medications and schizophrenics generally have a higher rate of suicide than the general population, so we cannot say how many lives would have been saved with clozapine. The story notes the rare, serious harms of clozapine and there is a comparison of mortality data of this medication with other anti-psychotics from the Finnish study. However, the story does not mention the other long-term, more common and also potentially serious side effects of clozapine and many other anti-psychotic medications. Clozapine is poorly tolerated (hypotension, sedation, constipation and others) and more common side effects limit tolerability and use. The story briefly discusses the design of the Finnish observational study comparing death rates of schizophrenics with the general non psychotic population. The story provides data that schizophrenics prescribed a once-considered dangerous drug actually had lower mortality rates than those prescribed other (newer) anti-psychotics. The story also mentions that people with schizophrenia typically die two decades earlier than other people. The story speculates about the reasons for reduced mortality, but there are many (medication and non-medication) reasons for earlier death among people with schizophrenia. The story didn’t give adequate explanation for the statement that thousands of lives worldwide could have been saved if patients had been treated differently. This is an overstatement and not an entirely correct interpretation of the study. There are cardiac risks associated with most anti-psychotic medications and schizophrenics generally have a higher rate of suicide than the general population, so we cannot say how many lives would have been saved with clozapine. Information in this story is based on a recently study published in the medical journal The Lancet. The story cites one author and two independent sources who provide good clinical perspective on results of this 10-year retrospective study of schizophrenics taking clozapine or newer anti-psychotics . The story focuses on clozapine as a viable drug treatment for schizophrenia when other anti-psychotic medication does not work. Use of the drug as a \"\"last resort\"\" should be reconsidered based on new evidence that there is lower long-term mortality risk with this drug compared to other commonly prescribed anti-psychotic medications. The story does not mention that patients taking clozapine are typically monitored frequently (weekly to monthly) for white blood cell counts (loss of white blood cells led to the death of patients taking the drug in the 1970s). The story also does not mention that some forms of psychotherapy are useful as adjunct treatment with medications for schizophrenics. There are also intensive community help programs that appear effective. The story does not mention that access to Clozapine (Clozaril) is still restricted in the U.S. WWW.CLOZARILCARE.COM. The story does note physicians’ reluctance to prescribe this medication based on rare but serious side effects which affect white blood cells and can lead to death. The story mentions the drug was \"\"banned\"\" from the market, but it was voluntarily removed from the market by the manufacturer after reports of rare but serious side effects. The story is also inaccurate when it says the drug is sold generically as Clozaril. Clozapine is the generic name. Clozapine is not a new medication; the story notes it has been available since the 1970’s. Since there is independent reporting and interviews with clinicians not affiliated with the Lancet paper it does not appear that the story relied on a news release.\"",

        "main_text": "\"At times, it hasn’t been 100 percent clear to vendors and shoppers what’s covered under Philadelphia’s sugary drinks tax. Look no further than that time ShopRite taxed hot sauce in January. But a high-ranking PepsiCo employee should probably understand, right? Well that’s not what it sounded like in a tweet earlier this week from the anti-tax coalition Ax The Bev Tax. The tweet replayed a conversation on WURD 900-AM between host Solomon Jones and Amy Chen, founder of PepsiCo’s Food for Good initiative. In the short clip, as presented in the tweet, Chen says, \"\"We offer a tremendous amount of low calorie, no calorie options, like waters, unsweetened products, low calorie diet items. All of which unfortunately are taxed by this tax.\"\" Unsweetened products and water, taxed? Um, what happened? First of all, unsweetened beverages and water are not taxed. According to the Mayor’s Office, the soda tax covers all non-alcoholic beverages with any amount of natural or artificial sweetener. Any unsweetened beverage and regular water would not be taxed. And even in the realm of sweetened beverages there are some exceptions. Drinks that are at least 50 percent milk, baby formula, 100 percent juice, at least 50 percent \"\"fresh\"\" fruit or vegetable  are not taxed. Chen’s conversation with Jones lasted for several minutes, based on the audio file from WURD’s website. So Ax The Bev Tax edited it down for purposes of the tweet. And not only did they shorten Chen’s conversation, the alteration of the clip adjusted what she said. In her original conversation with Jones, Chen said, \"\"We offer a tremendous amount of low calorie, no calorie options, like waters, unsweetened products, low calorie diet items. All of which unfortunately -- or most of which -- are taxed by this tax.\"\" Ax the Bev Tax’s clip removed \"\"or most of which,\"\" the portion of her statement where she realized her error of saying all those drinks would be taxed and corrected herself. Speaking for PepsiCo and Ax The Bev Tax, Anthony Campisi said it was an editing error committed by someone \"\"still getting oriented with the nuances of the tax\"\" and that the anti-soda tax coalition had consistently claimed from the beginning the tax only applies to sweetened beverages. He called it an honest mistake and said, \"\"this just seems like in the grand scheme of things about the beverage tax to be really small stuff.\"\" Our ruling The Ax The Bev Tax Twitter account played a clip of Pepsi employee Amy Chen saying \"\"We offer a tremendous amount of low calorie, no calorie options, like waters, unsweetened products, low calorie diet items.

She is fed, diapered, happy. The problem is the absolute disaster I come home to. Examples: He doesn't wipe off her highchair after feeding her and leaves food crusted to it. Dirty diapers are left on the changing table. Coffee and drinks spilled on the counter will run down the side and congeal there. He does often cook, but makes gigantic messes doing it and does not clean it up.\n\nToday is my day off and I have spent the last four hours cleaning up ants, mopping up mud from his shoes and attempting to conquer the laundry that has piled up in our bedroom. He is outside with his electronic cigarette reading because he needs to relax and it is my day to watch the baby.\n\nI feel completely overwhelmed. I already work full time at a demanding sales job.

        "claim": "TGen identifies drug that could limit the spread of deadly brain tumors",
        "date_published": "November 17, 2015",
        "explanation": "This news release describes the discovery of propentofylline, a drug that researchers claim could help patients with brain tumors. But there’s no justification for calling this test of a drug on brain tumor cells in a lab dish “a significant breakthrough.” Because of the murky wording of the release, and the many mentions of potential benefits to patients, as well as references to clinical trials (without being clear that those trials involved patients with Alzheimer’s and other diseases, not brain tumors), readers may not realize that the number of patients in this trial was exactly zero. The release also miscasts the threat posed by glioblastoma multiforme. It calls the disease the most common primary tumor of the brain and central nervous system and warns that “it affects people of all ages,” without noting that the disease is diagnosed in only about 2 or 3 people per 100,000 population each year, or only about 1 percent of all cancer cases. Glioblastoma multiforme is a devastating disease with little in the way of effective treatments. It is for this very reason that reports of potential new approaches should be measured and free of hyperbole and false hope. Most people are unaware just how few experimental drugs that show encouraging results in laboratory tests eventually show they can help real patients. While the results of this cell culture test may be worth investigating further, it is far too early to crow about potential benefits to patients.",
        "fact_checkers": "Andrew Holtz, MPH,Harold J. DeMonaco, MS,Kathlyn Stone",
        "main_text": "Even though propentofylline, the drug being studied, is not FDA approved for use in people, the release could have easily included some basic price information since the drug is currently sold for use in elderly dogs in many countries. One online pharmacy quotes a price of $67 for sixty 100 mg tablets tablets. Of course, the price would likely be higher for a drug that meets FDA standards for human use. The release is riddled with suggestions — but no specifics — of potential benefits. Some examples: The release is explicitly silent on the fact that the research was confined to the laboratory and did not involve patients. Not only does the release fail to mention any potential harms, it dismisses such concerns with a quote about “minimal side effects.” Readers would be forgiven for not realizing this study was done only on cells in a lab, not real patients, since that fundamental fact is glossed over in the release. The release calls glioblastoma multiforme “the most common primary tumor of the brain and central nervous system,” without noting how rare brain tumors are. The release should have noted that glioblastoma multiforme is diagnosed in about 22,000 people in the United States each year, accounting for barely more than 1 percent of all cancer cases. Glioblastoma multiforme kills about 15,000 people in the U.S. annually, representing about 2-1/2% percent of the total deaths attributed to cancers of all types. This type of tumor is indeed usually life threatening, but this news release misleads readers when it uses the term “common” without providing the full picture. The release notes that the research was funded by the Ben & Catherine IVY Foundation and NIH grants. While there are no truly effective treatments for glioblastoma multiforme, in this case it would have been helpful to compare this experimental approach to others being studied. In particular, the release could have noted that gene therapy, therapeutic vaccines, radio-labeled drugs and antibodies are also being tested, including tests in patients, an important contrast to this study, which was just a cell culture test. Although the release is clear that this approach is experimental, by failing to clearly point out the fact that the drug has yet to be tested in a single glioblastoma multiforme patient, it obscures just how preliminary and tentative these results are.The release gives the reader the false impression that PPF has already been approved for this purpose with this statement: “An advantage of small-molecule PPF — which has been previously used in clinical trials in an attempt to treat Alzheimer’s disease and dementia — is that it can penetrate the blood-brain barrier and reach the tumor. And, the FDA has already approved it.” The release fails to note that other researchers have previously released similar findings based on tests on propentofylline in rats and cell culture. Propentofylline decreases tumor growth in a rodent model of glioblastoma multiforme by a direct mechanism on microglia. Propentofylline Targets TROY, a Novel Microglial Signaling Pathway Calling this lab test “a significant breakthrough” misleads readers. Quotes and text throughout the release refer to potential benefits to patients even though this test was done in cell cultures. The actual effects in patients with glioblastoma multiforme are unknown.",

And the amount of time we have hang out has kinda gone down from when we first met. He hasn't been ignoring me in like text and stuff and he got me a christmas gift (something we never discussed and was totally unexpected) so I don't think he is trying to fade out on me. \n\nBut I still feel like uncertain with things I guess. All of my friends tell me I shouldn't put all my eggs in one basket and I should continue to like see other guys. But this makes me feel like wrong or something. For one I don't want to sleep with anyone else or do anything (kissing, dating, whatever) with anyone else, and two I would just feel like I'm leading everyone on who gets involved. I think they are telling me this cause they don't want to see me get hurt and they are just trying to help but it just kinda seems like a bad idea to me. Especially cause me and this guy have talked about being exclusive, but we haven't had the bf and gf talk, and I really don't want to see other people. So ya I feel like my issue is pretty silly but I wanted to see what other people had to say I guess.\n\nTL;DR:",

        "claim": "Largest U.S. needle exchange tries free meth pipes in Seattle.",
        "date_published": "May 14, 2015",
        "explanation": "Occasional crystal meth smoker Richard Russell ambles up to a church storage garage in a Seattle alley and a recovering drug addict hands him two brand new meth pipes, no questions asked.",
        "fact_checkers": "Eric M. Johnson",
        "main_text": "One of about two dozen methamphetamine users who received free bubble-ended pipes on a recent afternoon, Russell is a  participant in a pioneering but illegal program launched in March that aims to indirectly curb infectious diseases. “Dude’s got something to smoke but he doesn’t have a pipe, what’s he going to do?” Russell said later as he munched on a sandwich. “Panhandle, steal. Inject.”  The theory behind the handout program is that giving meth pipes to drug users may steer some away from needles, which are far riskier than smoking, especially if the user is sharing with another person infected with HIV or hepatitis C.  There is little scientific evidence to support that claim, but The People’s Harm Reduction Alliance, a privately funded needle-swap group run by drug users, said it has distributed more than 1,000 pipes in Seattle in a matter of weeks and could expand to other cities in Washington state and Oregon. Its program also draws addicts from society’s fringes into its compassionate fold, with links to treatment and housing services, Executive Director Shilo Murphy said. Even though needle exchanges have faced continued opposition in many parts of the United States since the first legal one opened in Tacoma, Washington in 1988, the programs have been credited with reducing HIV infections and saving lives. But opponents say giving away meth pipes discourages quitting while wasting resources on an untested scheme that will not solve a city-wide health problem. They note that among methamphetamine-using gay men, HIV is transmitted primarily through unprotected sex, not syringe- or pipe-sharing. There are no studies to show meth users will resort to injections if pipes are unavailable, or that handing out pipes prevents needle use, said Matthew Golden, a Seattle and King County Disease Control Officer and a University of Washington professor of medicine. It is also hard to quantify how much the campaign might prevent death or infection, if at all, even if it does give meth users safer options than a needle or smoking out of a jerry-rigged light bulb, Golden said. “It is plausible the intervention could be effective,” Golden said. “It’s simply an unstudied idea.”   But the Alliance, which says it is the nation’s largest needle-exchange program by syringes dispersed, has pushed legal boundaries for years with user-conceived experiments unacceptable to its taxpayer-funded counterparts, Murphy said. It faced public outcry five years ago with a similarly illegal campaign to hand out crack pipes with extension tubes to prevent the hot glass from blistering addicts’ lips, on the theory that disease could spread between pipe-sharers through open wounds, Murphy said. A similar program began in San Francisco last year. The Alliance launched its meth pipe program after learning from its own survey that 80 percent of area meth users would be less likely to inject drugs if given access to pipes. On a recent afternoon in an alley near the leafy University of Washington campus, dozens of drug users ambled up to a makeshift table to dump fistfuls of dirty syringes into biohazard bins and retrieve fresh boxes of needles, as well as meth pipes. Addicts, among them a transient man with a military-style backpack and two glassy-eyed college-age youths, also helped themselves to supplies like cookers, pushers and latex ties, as well as condoms and health pamphlets. “We don’t see this as controversial. We see this as what’s needed in our community,” Murphy said. Giving out meth or crack pipes is illegal under state law, but the Seattle Police Department said it has taken no action to actively monitor or shutter the program. Anti-drug groups say needle exchanges make hard drug use appear acceptable and bring crime to communities, among other concerns. Phillip Wilson, 56, said the pipe programs were harming the community, adding that he planned to re-sell the glassware he got on the street for about $10. “Come on man, giving that shit away to people who are trying to quit? I just can’t understand it,” he said.",

        "claim": "Taking Fish Oil During Pregnancy Is Found to Lower Child’s Asthma Risk",
        "date_published": "January 3, 2017",
        "explanation": "This New York Times story looks at a new study showing a reduced risk of asthma in the children of mothers who took high doses of fish oil during the last trimester of pregnancy. The story was strong–it did a lot of things well. We were especially pleased to see the Times use both absolute and relative risk numbers when conveying the measured benefit. We learn, for example, that fish oil reduced the risk of asthma 31 percent, the relative risk benefit. That is tempered by inclusion of the absolute risk reduction–16.9% of mothers who supplemented had children with asthma, compared to 23.7 of mothers taking a placebo. This helps readers keep expectations in check. The main shortcoming is the story’s failure to disclose relevant conflicts of interest. One of the researchers has a financial interest in the genetic testing he advocates in the story — and readers should be aware of that interest as they consider his recommendations. Other than avoidance of smoking by the mother, there is currently no known way to prevent asthma from developing in a child, and the World Health Organization defines its global health and economic impact as “severe.” Given how common this disease is, news coverage on this study will be highly read, making it vital to distill the results accurately. This story did so, and provided important context to let parents know that researchers aren’t yet ready to recommend high-dose fish oil supplementation to pregnant women.",
        "fact_checkers": "Joy Victory,Karen Carlson, MD,Kevin Lomangino",
        "main_text": "The story did not discuss cost. There are dozens of fish oil supplements on the market and their cost varies widely. The story could have given some sense of the financial impact that this regimen would have. This was a strong point of the story, giving us both absolute and relative risk figures up front in the second paragraph: Among children whose mothers took fish-oil capsules, 16.9 percent had asthma by age 3, compared with 23.7 percent whose mothers were given placebos. The difference, nearly 7 percentage points, translates to a risk reduction of about 31 percent. Too often, even when stories do provide absolute risk figures, they highlight relative risks high up in the story and bury the absolute risk information far down in the text where it’s less likely to be read. The story explains that no adverse events were associated with the intervention. However, the harms assessed by the researchers were things like maternal or infant death, emergency caesarean delivery, and preterm birth. They didn’t assess (and the story didn’t mention) less serious harms like fishy taste, nausea, belching, and heartburn that are commonly associated with fish oil capsules and which might make this regimen burdensome for pregnant women. Moreover, it would have been useful if the story had also noted that the reason researchers want to replicate the results in a larger group of women is to make sure these very high doses of fish oil are indeed safe. The story gives us details of the study–how many women were enrolled, that there was a placebo group, and that the children were followed for seven years. An independent source also explains that the study was “well designed and carefully performed.” The story does not disease monger–childhood asthma is a common and often exasperating condition that many parents grapple with. The story clearly explains who funded the study, and includes an independent source. But it doesn’t note the extensive conflicts of interest reported by the lead author who’s quoted in the piece: Dr. Bisgaard reports receiving consulting fees from Chiesi Pharmaceuticals and Boehringer Ingelheim, and Drs. Bisgaard and Bønnelykke report being named on a pending patent related to the prevention of childhood asthma through FADS genotyping and the assessment of blood levels of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid in pregnant mothers. The patent filing related to genetic testing is particularly relevant, given that the researcher advocates genetic testing and testing of fish oil levels in pregnant women to determine who might benefit most from supplementation. Aside from avoidance of maternal smoking, there are no known ways to reduce the risk of developing asthma in childhood. The story explains this is why doctors are testing this method, and excited by the findings. The story explains that the “capsules were an over-the-counter product called Incromega TG33/22, a fish extract made by the British chemical company Croda Health Care.” And in regard to whether women should start taking the supplement to lower asthma risk in their babies, the story lets us know researchers “are not ready to recommend that pregnant women routinely take fish oil” due to the very high dose used in this study. Further research is needed first to establish safety and confirm benefit. We learn that previous studies on this topic were inconclusive, and so the inference is that this is the first time more conclusive results were seen, especially regarding the benefit in women who had lower-than-normal levels of the fatty acids in their blood. This story did not rely on the news release.",

I was in a car accident as a passenger and later had a work accident. Knocked out both times. Since then my ability to handle stress or even leave my house to work has been getting worse. I work full time but it's temporary. This is on top of years of being tested for stomach conditions. I don't have anyone to really talk to about it. \n\nMy doctor tells me that my brain just works differently now and I have to learn to cope.  My skill set probably would translate over to an at home job, I have a graphic design and art education degree, my doctor recommends I try to work from home. Do those just magically appear? As much as I'd love to work from home I have no idea were to look for one with out being asked for money or worrying about scams. My temporary job, while full time, doesn't give me health benefits so I can't ask the doctor for medication. My stomach condition makes it incredibly difficult to take medication without becoming sick. It makes me fell like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. I just want to feel better and not feel stressed all the time.\n\nTL;DR:",

        "explanation": "This Wall Street Journal article describes results of an unpublished, non-peer-reviewed study of a gene-based test designed to help physicians prescribe antidepressants in people with moderate-to-severe depression who have failed on at least one of the drugs. The story, both in the narrative and in some quotes, adds some moderating context and healthy skepticism to the enthusiastic “landmark” claims from a company release. It also is clear about the cost ($1,500) of the test offered by Myriad Genetics. But it needed to examine more closely the fact that the test can’t really tell a psychiatrist or other physician which of the dozens of antidepressants may work best–only which are most likely to cause problems and should be avoided. If this is the case, what’s driving the (small) benefit? Is it because people whose treatment was guided by genetic testing experienced fewer side effects and therefore were more likely to adhere to treatment? We’re not told. Federally-funded surveys of mental health in the U.S. consistently estimate that around 15 to 20 million adult Americans have moderate-to-severe depression that warrants treatment. The good news is that there are dozens of antidepressant drugs approved by the FDA for use alone or with other, non-drug therapies. The bad news is that, as the WSJ article underscores, finding the right medicine for any given patient is largely a matter of highly subjective clinical judgment and trial and error, sometimes for years. Moreover, the drugs are often not cheap and may cause side effects. Thus, the application of gene-based “precision medicine” testing — in this case to test for a dozen or so genes that may help predict how classes of drugs are metabolized and used by the body and brain — is potentially big news.",
        "fact_checkers": "Joann Rodgers, MS,Susan Molchan, MD, MA,Joy Victory",
        "main_text": "The story makes clear that the test is expensive and that Medicare and some other insurance plans cover it. Although the article provides data about the total number of people randomized to the two arms of the study, it does not go beyond what the news release offers about the percentage/relative increases in remission of symptoms and response to drugs. No absolute numbers are given, so it’s impossible to know how many of the patients in each arm actually benefited and to what extent. All it provides is the relative improvement in “response” to medication: “researchers found a 30% greater response to the medicine when the test was applied.” No data is provided for remission. But when you look at the raw numbers regarding remission rates, and compare the results of both groups, they don’t look as impressive: Of those who didn’t receive genetic testing, 10% reached remission. With the tests, it was 15%. This gives the reader perspective that the absolute difference was 5%. Also, the news release hints that at least some of the results might not have been statistically significant, and we’re curious about that and think it should have been explained in the story: “The GeneSight-treated cohort also demonstrated higher symptom improvement which approached statistical significance (Chart 1).” The test itself — using DNA taken from a cheek swab — carries no physical risks. But the story needed more detail about the potential downsides. As noted in more detail in the TIME coverage of the story, the various “scales” that are used to assess drugs aren’t organized by how effective the drugs might be based on genetics, but instead how many adverse events they might cause. So, a person is told to take certain drugs not because they’ll be more effective than other drugs, they’re just less likely to cause problems. Could selecting drugs based on how many problems they cause lead some people to choose drugs that aren’t as effective for treating depression? That would seem to be biggest issue in terms of harms — that the test would simply be wrong for some people. Also, the test appears to show results for drugs beyond antidepressants — including some drugs that are known to cause dependency or can be deadly when taken alone, mixed together or with other drugs, such as hypnotics and benzodiazepines (Ambien and Xanax, for example). This is important to consider in a group of people already at higher risk for suicide. All of this means adverse event data is vital — was it indeed lower in the gene-tested group? If adverse event data were not available from the company or the investigators at the University of Michigan who led the study, the article could have noted the fact. The story did not do enough to establish that this research is still preliminary — it has not been published nor peer-reviewed, and everyone is relying on just a little bit of data released by the company. We should all be skeptical at this point. No disease mongering here; moderate to severe depression is a real and prevalent disorder and danger. We also thought it was wise how the story included a patient narrative with unclear results–she’s feeling better, but not 100%. That is a very powerful way to explain that this new tool isn’t a silver bullet. The story quotes outside experts and notes that the principal investigator is an unpaid consultant to the company that makes the test. We’re also told that the study was funded by the maker of the genetic test. Although quantification is mostly missing, the article properly points out that clinical judgment-based treatment alone misses the mark a lot of the time, and is essentially educated guesswork. The article might have been strengthened even more had it given information about alternatives or adjuncts to drugs, such as behavioral therapy and electroshock therapy. It’s clear from the story that the test, marketed as GeneSight, is available. The story is pretty careful to put the findings of the study — presented at a conference in New York — in the context of overall advances in the use of pharmacogenetics and precision medicine, treatments increasingly tailored to an individual’s genetic makeup. And it notes that the Myriad Genetics test is not the only player in the gene-based medicine field. The story also includes the information that the study was “blinded” and randomized, but (happily) avoids the hyperbole of the news release which calls it a “landmark” study and the largest ever of its kind. As noted above, the article quotes outside sources.",

        "explanation": "This story opens readers’ eyes to a debate that flared up before attendees of a recent meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology – but a debate that most of us wouldn’t know about. The sidebar story, “Some Stealth Marketing by a ‘Hot Chemo’ Company,” was an important addition. This is an important piece of enterprise journalism. The “chemo bath” approach has been around for many years, but the use of heated solutions is relatively new and has limited data to support it use. Despite the limited evidence, the approach is gaining in acceptance. Anyone who’s heard about is smarter after reading this piece.",

        "main_text": "Good job on this, stating “The cost of the surgery and Hipec, including hospitalization, ranges from $20,000 to more than $100,000, doctors said. While Medicare and insurers generally pay for the operation, the heated treatment may not be covered. But doctors added it may be if it is described merely as chemotherapy.” The story explained: “One randomized trial done more than a decade ago involving 105 patients in the Netherlands did show a striking benefit. The median survival of those getting surgery and Hipec, plus intravenous chemotherapy, was 22.3 months, almost double the 12.6 months for those getting only the intravenous chemotherapy” That being said, the story also included the proviso that newer drugs are now available that have been shown to increase survival. The story explains that one study showed that “8 percent who got the surgery and Hipec died from the treatment itself.”  And it stated: Includes one expert statement:  ““We’re practicing this technique that has almost no basis in science.” No disease mongering. Many different voices with different perspectives were heard in the story. Various comparisons were made – on both sides of the debate. A proponent of the new method said:  ““there are no long-term survivors with systemic chemotherapy — zero.” But the story also said: “critics say that …new drugs have come to market that allow patients with metastatic colorectal cancer to live two years with intravenous chemotherapy alone” The story states that “an increasing number of the nation’s leading medical centers has been offering the costly — and controversial — therapy to patients with the more common colorectal or ovarian cancers” and names some of them. The growing use of the approach was clear in the story. And the fact that one randomized trial was done fully a decade ago. The story benefited from independent reporting.",

        "claim": "Rhode Island has the highest percentage of uninsured adults of any state in New England.",
        "date_published": "January 4, 2011",
        "explanation": "Health clinic executive says Rhode Island has the highest rate of uninsured adults in New England",
        "fact_checkers": "C. Eugene Emery Jr.",
        "main_text": "\"The cost of health care is a huge issue for everyone. If you have health insurance, the chances are excellent that you've seen your costs, along with co-payments and deductibles, go up significantly. If you don't have health insurance, the bill you get from your doctor or hospital is strikingly higher than what people with health insurance are charged. That's because insurance companies negotiate deep discounts that uninsured people never see. And because people who don't have insurance are seven times more likely to skip the care they need, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that typically makes your care more expensive when you do seek it. If, on top of everything else, you can't pay for that care and a hospital provides it for free, as a hospital is obligated to do, those costs are passed on to everyone else. So it caught our attention when Marie Ghazal, chief executive officer of the Rhode Island Free Clinic, the Providence nonprofit organization that treats the uninsured, began an opinion column in The Providence Journal by asserting that \"\"Rhode Island has the highest percentage of uninsured adults of any state in New England.\"\" She stated that between 13.9 percent and 21.4 percent of residents are not insured, which translates to 139,000 to 214,000 Rhode Islanders. We wondered if our ranking was really that poor, and why the range was so large. When we contacted Ghazal, she said she got the information from a story in the Providence Business News. The article gives no specific numbers for Rhode Island or most other states. It was based on a map developed by the CDC that breaks the states into three categories: those having the highest proportion of people with health insurance, those having the lowest and those in between. Rhode Island -- like New York, New Jersey, Ohio, Virginia and most of the states in the Midwest -- is in the in-between category. Ghazal said our rate of uninsured adults was 13.9 percent to 21.4 percent because, as it turns out, that's how the CDC defined the in-between group. We asked if she had specific numbers. She said she didn't. So we went searching. When we contacted CDC, they directed us to state-by-state numbers, as collected by Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, a telephone survey that counts how many people are without health insurance at the time of the call. According to the BRFSS statistics, which served as the basis for the map cited by Ghazal, the 2009 telephone survey of 4,318 Rhode Islands found that the percentage of uninsured adults in Rhode Island was 14.2 percent, below the national average of 16.9 percent. Thirty-two states had a lower rate of health insurance coverage than Rhode Island. The worst rate was in Texas, where 29.1 percent of the population was not covered. In 15 states, at least 20 percent of the adult population younger than 65 was without health insurance. But we found something else while digging into the numbers. The margin of error in the survey was plus or minus 1.9 percentage points. If you ignore the margin of error, it is true that Rhode Island had the highest rate of uninsured adults in New England. Maine, where 13.7 percent were uninsured, was closest to Rhode Island. But that's a difference of only 0.5 percentage points. Massachusetts, in contrast, had the lowest rate of uninsured -- 6.2 percent -- because the Bay State has mandatory health insurance. However, if you consider the margin of error in the poll, we could rank ahead of New Hampshire (where 13.1 were uninsured) and Maine. For additional context, we looked at the percentages going back to 1995 (excluding 2001 and 2002, two years when the survey results are not on the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention & Health Promotion website). It turns out that in 2004, the level of uninsured in Rhode Island was a bit higher -- 14.4 percent; 15 years ago it was at about 13 percent. The rate did dip to 11.7 percent in the 1998 survey but, in general, the numbers have stayed consistent. By any measure, that's still a lot of people walking around without health insurance. Ultimately, if you ignore the margin of error, Ghazal is correct about our ranking compared with other New England states. But if you take that into account, its possible that her statement could be inaccurate. More importantly, she's making a selective comparison. When you compare us with the rest of the country, we're better than average. Because of those omissions.\"",

        "claim": "Diet shown to reduce stroke risk may also reduce risk of depression",
        "date_published": "February 28, 2018",
        "explanation": "The release focuses on a forthcoming, preliminary study that will be presented at a conference in April. The release reports that people who closely follow the so-called “DASH diet” are less likely to report symptoms of depression than people who do not adhere to the DASH diet. However, there are a number of unanswered questions. For example, the study appears to have focused on older adults with an average age of 81 so it’s not clear whether the findings would be relevant for younger adults. It’s also unclear whether depression leads to a change in dietary patterns. Common sense suggests lack of energy and motivation are negatively affected by depression and consequently may lead people to cook less frequently. And it’s not clear how closely any of the groups being studied adhered to the DASH diet. For further analysis of the study, the news release and resulting news coverage see our blog post. Clinical depression is a significant health issue, which can have profound ramifications for a patient’s well being and quality of life. There are a variety of treatment options available, but many of those options can be expensive or raise the possibility of adverse side effects. As a result, the idea that a lifestyle change, such as diet, could reduce the risk of depression is an attractive one. However, adopting a new diet is a big step for many people. It’s important for readers to understand the evidence behind the claims that a diet can significantly affect mental health risks. This release does some things well — such as noting at the very end that the study shows an association, not cause and effect. However, the release lacks key details that would allow people to clearly understand the underlying study.",
        "fact_checkers": "Matt Shipman,Yoni Freedhoff, MD,Kathlyn Stone",
        "main_text": "Costs are not discussed. However, the “treatment” at issue is not a drug or medical technology with clearly defined costs. Rather, the DASH diet focuses on an individual’s food choices. While there are cost constraints associated with any diet, and many people do not have easy access to the fruit and vegetables that are at the heart of the DASH diet, it would be challenging to address those issues in any meaningful way in the context of a news release like this one. That being the case, we’ll rate this as “not applicable.” The release states that “The odds of becoming depressed over time was 11 percent lower among the top group of DASH adherers versus the lowest group.”  Here the release is relying on relative risk reduction figures which are far less meaningful to patients than numbers that explain the absolute risk reduction. We also are left wondering how closely the “top group of DASH adherers” followed the DASH diet? To what extent did that differ from the “lowest group”? The release does not address potential harms. However, there are few (if any) harms associated with adopting a well-balanced diet that is high in fruits and vegetables. While it is always wise to consult a physician before making significant lifestyle changes, we feel that this is not necessarily something that a news release needs to state explicitly. With that in mind, we give this a satisfactory rating. One of the biggest problems with the release concerns lack of evidence concerning the DASH diet’s potential impact on depression. Does depression lead to a change in dietary patterns? Fatigue and lack of motivation — both hallmarks of depression — may lead people to cook less frequently. Research also suggests that sugary foods lower cortisol levels more than other foods and consequently people with depression may choose them preferentially over a DASH style diet since they provide them with some therapeutic relief. And further, these are older adults (average age of 81). If they were to develop conditions that affected their energy, mobility, chronic pain, etc. this would also influence their dietary choices and impact these results. The release includes a caution at the end stating the study doesn’t prove cause and effect. That’s good, but we think the causal claim in the headline — “may also reduce depression” — will overshadow that message. No disease mongering here. The release notes that the study was supported by the National Institute on Aging, which is good. However, conflicts of interest are not explicitly addressed. Given that only one of the researchers involved with the study was named, it is impossible for readers to determine if there are any conflicts of interest. For example, one can buy any number of DASH diet cookbooks online — are any study co-authors associated with those? Given the paucity of information in the release, it’s impossible to tell. (As noted above, we obtained a copy of the study abstract and didn’t see any obvious conflicts of interest — but the information isn’t readily available in the release.) One alternative raised in the release is the Mediterranean diet. But the release doesn’t describe the Mediterranean diet or quantify how adherence to that diet was associated with a decreased risk of depression symptoms. Other factors that can contribute to reduced risk of depression aren’t discussed. The release refers repeatedly to the DASH diet. However, while the DASH diet has been around for years, many readers will likely never have heard of it. The release appears to assume that the DASH diet is common knowledge. While the DASH diet isn’t a secret, it’s not something you can assume readers are familiar with either. This could have been addressed by simply noting that the DASH diet has, well, been around for years. It could even have referred readers to a description of the plan on an NIH website. This is far from the first study to assess relationships between diet and depression. For example, a 2013 paper in Annals of Neurology that looked at (among other things) nine different studies involving the Mediterranean diet and depression. How does this forthcoming conference paper fit into that expansive body of work? It’s not clear. Based on the release, readers may think this is the first study to consider a link between diet and depression. To be clear, this research may well address novel research questions, but the release doesn’t make clear what those are — particularly in the context of previous work in the field. This is a tricky one. The release does one thing that we don’t like — and it does that thing more than once. The headline says “Diet…may also reduce risk of depression” (emphasis added). The first sentence says “People…may have lower rates of depression…” (emphasis added). In either instance, the release could just as easily have said “may not.” It begs the question of why the news release was issued at this point. However, we want to applaud two things the release does do. First, the release explicitly states that “the study does not prove that the DASH diet leads to a reduced risk of depression; it only shows an association.” That is such an important point to make, and we think that is great. Second, the release also quotes one of the researchers as saying “Future studies are now needed to confirm these results and to determine the best nutritional components of the DASH diet to prevent depression later in life and to best help people keep their brains healthy.” Again, this is an important point and we are very glad to see it addressed. All in all, we give it a satisfactory rating here.",

I work 9/5 come home have to clean, do the laundry and cook dinner every single night. I'm not saying thats her job or anything and I know she's sick but she should have to hold her share of this relationship. It feels like I'm living with a roommate.\n\nWhile the notion of starting a family has me excited at first, I mention to her that if we do decide to go through with having a family she would have to stop smoking weed. Initially she agrees and stops. Now after a few days she has become so unbearable to be around to the point I don't want to go home anymore. She's constantly yelling at me and the dogs, throwing things and threatining to hurt herself all because she's in pain.\n\nI've offered to take her to the hospital, or even the regular doctor to get some actual medical help but she refuses.\n\nTL;DR:",

(8) В 1902 году царское правительство аннулировало избрание Максима Горького в почётные академики. (9)В знак протеста Короленко и Чехов отказались от звания академиков. (10)Для Чехова это был акт не только общественный, но и личный. (11)Он писал в заявлении, что при избрании Горького он повидался с ним и первый поздравил его. (12)А теперь, когда Академия наук известила, что выборы недействительны, выходит, что он, Чехов, как академик, признаёт это. (13)«Я Поздравлял сердечно, и я же признаю выборы недействительными — такое противоречие не укладывается в моём сознании, примирить с ним свою совесть я не мог, — писал он в Академию наук.— И после долгого размышления я мог прийти только к одному решению... о сложении с меня звания почётного академика». (14)А ведь так сложились обстоятельства, вроде независимые от Чехова, и он мог бы найти для себя оправдание. (15)Убеждения, конечно, вещь необходимая. (16)Но есть такое более простое, конкретное понятие, как слово, данное человеком. (17)Оно не подтверждено никаким документом, справкой. (18)Просто слово. (По Д. Гранину)",

        "date_published": "July 23, 2007",
        "explanation": "\"This is a story about a commercial method for cooling patients who have suffered cardiac arrest in an attempt to prevent brain damage. The story did not clearly define whom the treatment might benefit or how often the treatment is successful at providing benefit. Yet it found time to quote the CEO of the company making the cooling device. The story reported on one patient who said she \"\"shouldn’t have made it\"\" and who related that doctors had told her that if she had not received the treatment she would have been \"\"dead or brain damaged\"\". However – the story provided no background information to help readers assess the veracity of these statements; nor did it provide any indication of how often the treatment resulted in the outcomes experienced by this patient. It provided little to help a reader learn more about when the treatment might be considered an appropriate option. Overall, this was a story of high human interest that was lacking in any meaningful discussion of evidence for benefits or harms, a lack of clarity about the population for whom this is intended, and too strong a focus on the product of one specific company. This is the third such story on cooling of cardiac arrest patients that we’ve reviewed so far this year. It appears to be something that local medical centers who use the approach like to promote. We hope that they – and the journalists who cover them – include more evidence in future promotions or news stories.\"",

        "main_text": "\"There was no information about the cost of this treatment. The story reported on one patient that by self report \"\"shouldn’t have made it\"\" and who related that doctors had told her that if she had not received the treatment she would have been \"\"dead or brain damaged\"\". However – the story provided no background information to help readers assess the veracity of these statements; nor did it provide any indication of how often the treatment resulted in the outcomes experienced by this patient. The story did not include mention of any complications or harms associated with this treatment. The complications of cooling include coagulopathy, arrhythmias, hyperglycemia, and increased risk of pneumonia and sepsis. While making mention of vague endorsement by the American Heart Association, the story did not include information about studies demonstrating efficacy of this approach. The story mentioned that Massachusetts General Hospital used this treatment for 12 patients in 2006; it did not mention how many actually survived. Although a dozen heart attack patients seems like a small number of patients for a large metropolitan hospital, the story gave no indication as to why this approach was used for these patients but not for others. Because the story did not clarify whether this treatment was of potential benefit for all people who have a myocardial infaraction or those who have cardiac arrest – it makes it seem like the treatment would help a much larger group of people than it actually does. This is a treatment only for those individuals who suffer cardiac arrest. It is also an example of treatment mongering, including the unsubstantiated claim that this could be \"\"saving thousands of lives\"\" – all without any mention of potential problems, harms, or contraindications. The story included quotes from a person in the cardiac intensive care unit at the local hospital where the patient featured in the story was treated. It included information from the CEO of the manufacturer of the medical device used for the treatment. This story should have included information from an independent expert who could have provided some context for the use of this treatment. The story did not mention other devices or approaches for inducing hypothermia in patients ; it also failed to discuss other treatment options for minimizing damage following cardiac arrest. The story discussed the availability of this treatment, indicating that it was available in only some hospitals. The story made clear that the treatment was not new but that it was not widely available. It may be of interest to readers of this website that we reviewed stories on 2/27/2007 from the CBS Evening News and on 3/28/2007 from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on this same treatment. All three stories appear to be prompted by news releases from local medical centers now using the cooling procedure. We can’t be sure if the story relied solely or largely on a news release. It does highlight the story of only one patient at only one Boston hospital.\"",

        "date_published": "November 1, 2016",
        "explanation": "Credit: The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences This story reports on a group of researchers who have derived a compound from hookworm spit that they have tested with some success as a treatment for asthmatic mice. Scientists have observed for several years now that rates of autoimmune disorders and allergies are lower in some low-income nations. The idea is that hygienic practices in high-income nations may have robbed people’s immune systems of natural checks provided by parasites or other microorganisms in their environments. The result, according to this theory, is higher rates of diseases like asthma, Crohn’s disease, and ulcerative colitis. The researchers quoted in this article first tried infecting patients with celiac disease with live hookworms, then in a more recent study synthesized a compound from hookworm spit for the mouse experiment. The problem is that the article overstates the potential benefits of a treatment that has not yet been tested in humans (a problem we see fairly often in news stories). Given that limitation, we would expect the story would at least provide testimony by independent experts who could weigh in on whether this new finding is important or not, but it doesn’t. The results of existing and ongoing research on the same topic are mixed at this point, but the article doesn’t say so. In sum, this story doesn’t give readers to tools to assess either quality or impact of the research described. This story is careful to convey the message that ingesting parasites on your own from an unregulated overseas market is not safe. What it doesn’t do is to provide a balanced picture of what the results of this study mean. We argue that patients who are struggling with these health issues in themselves or their children deserve to get a thoughtful contextualization of what these findings mean in the current state of knowledge on the topic.",

        "main_text": "The story speculates at length about potential benefits of this treatment, before ever establishing that this is preliminary research. Our guideline is “if it’s not too early to talk about benefits, then it’s not too early to talk about costs.” This story didn’t do so. The heading of the article is eye catching: blood-sucking parasitic worms! The health of millions improved! It’s not until about two-thirds of the way through the article that it becomes clear these claims are based on the findings of a laboratory study of asthmatic mice, and so there are no actual benefits to report on. The treatment hasn’t yet been tested in humans. The article does make an attempt to explain how similarities in mouse and human anatomy suggest that humans might benefit from the same treatment. It also notes that “their [the researchers’] next step is a phase one clinical trial, which would test the effectiveness of an AIP-2 pill.” Actually, phase I trials assess safety and appropriate dosage for new medications. Final effectiveness of new treatments is not assessed until much later, in phase III trials. Any possible benefits of this treatment to the public, therefore, are considerably farther down the road than the article implies. Furthermore, findings from other studies in the line of research are mixed. All in all, the statement that AIP-2 “may make millions of people healthier” is premature. As we’ve stated many times, mouse research is usually not newsworthy because of these challenges. The article provides some explanation of the potential harms of ingesting live hookworms for therapeutic purposes. It warns against readers “trying this at home,” especially in the cases of young children and pregnant women. No statement is made about the potential harms of treatments derived from hookworm spit or similar compounds, but at least most readers probably won’t leave this article with the impression that buying hookworms overseas and self-infecting is a great idea. Two studies from the same lab are mentioned in the article. The first involved 12 patients with celiac disease. The article reports that their tolerance for gluten “improved” after ingesting live hookworms, but it is very short on details. There is no explanation of how long they were treated, how much they improved, or even whether there was a control group. The story states that it is “difficult to scale” that kind of study because of the challenges in finding patients who are willing to be infected with live parasites. It does not mention that the small sample size would also make it impossible to generalize any findings to the larger population. More information is provided about the study that is the main focus of the article, a laboratory experiment in which mice were treated with a compound synthesized from hookworm spit. But the story provides no sense of how challenging it will be to translate these results to humans, a very important caveat that should have been discussed. The article does not engage in disease mongering. No independent sources are cited. Although the article talks about 235 million asthma sufferers across the world, it provides no description of the challenges they face or the limitations of current treatment options. It’s not clear, therefore, why or for what types of people an alternative treatment is needed and what this treatment might have to offer over the status quo. The story does’t address availability. As we explain in the quantified benefits criterion above, the most readers get is an erroneous statement about the next steps: “Navarro said their next step is a phase one clinical trial, which would test the effectiveness of an AIP-2 pill.” A phase one trial is actually to test safety–not effectiveness–and this error may have the effect of making this pill seem closer to reality than it is. Research about therapeutic use of hookworms and other parasitic worms (helminths) has been around since the 1990s, although it has entered into the public consciousness within the past five years at most. So in one sense, the material in this article is novel. The beginning of the story describes the genesis of this line of research in questions about the connection between the dramatic success of deworming programs around the world and the rise of immune system problems like asthma and celiac disease. However, the article makes no mention of multiple previous and ongoing studies investigating the effects of “worm therapy” on auto-immune diseases like Crohn’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and asthma. The idea that parasites may play a role in the development of the human immune system is still surprising for most of us, but not as novel as this report on the findings of a single research group would suggest–just a few months ago we reviewed an NPR story on worms for allergies. The article should have provided more context. The story appears to include novel quotes from the researchers that were not taken from the news release.",

        "date_published": "",
        "explanation": "All things considered, the evidence presented to support this fairly outlandish notion is either false or misleading, and we cannot find any plausible mechanism for a raw cut onion stuffed in your sock to reduce any disease.",
        "fact_checkers": "Alex Kasprak",
        "main_text": "Like so many questionable bits of scientific misinformation, the claim that putting onions on your feet will do something unspecified that has to do with “toxins” is repeated with similar or identical language on many different web sites. One site that has given this concept undue attention is that of David ‘Avocado’ Wolfe, a prolific purveyor of misinterpreted science and blenders. He explains the basic rationale in a November 2016 post: The Chinese found that there are thousands of tiny nerve endings on the bottom of the feet. These nerve endings act as access points to the internal organs. They are also closely linked to the nervous system. Onions have strong anti-bacterial and anti-viral properties. When you cut an onion and place it on the bottom of the foot, it gets right to work removing toxins and healing your body. If that explanation isn’t doing it for you, Wolfe provides additional reasoning as well. But, like a desperate student called on in class after a heavy night of not studying, Wolfe lists numerous unrelated, disconnected, illogical, and wholly inaccurate claims about how an onions on your feet might impart a health benefit in the hopes that the sheer volume of answers will not betray his own lack of knowledge. Only three of these five explanations hold even a modicum of relevance to the onion sock theory: Onions detox the body – Onions are rich in sulphuric compounds. These compounds are responsible for their strong odor. Sulfer [sic] helps the body release unwanted toxins, especially in the liver. Onions purify your blood – While the onion is next to your foot, phosphoric acid is released. It enters your bloodstream and helps to purify the blood running through your veins. […] Onions support the immune system – Thanks to the anti-bacterial and anti-viral properties of onions, your immune system becomes better prepared to fight off infections and inflammation. […] With these claims in place, we can get a general picture of how Wolfe and others suggest this works: Borrowing from the Traditional Chinese Medicine concept of meridians, the feet are a gateway to multiple organ systems in your body which allow chemicals from the onion to enter your bloodstream like a portal, where they get to purifying, bacteria killing, and virus fighting. First off, the existence of meridians have not been demonstrated scientifically, and even if they had been, practitioners of Traditional Chinese Medicine describe their action as transporting energy or “qi”, not as transporting actual physical compounds, so Wolfe’s description of the mechanism by which beneficial onion compounds make it to your body is not off to a great start. Ignoring this problematic beginning, the next claim refers to an onion’s sulphuric compounds. They do indeed exist, and they have indeed been proposed as the primary chemicals responsible for an onion’s medicinal benefits. A 2002 review in the journal Phytotherapy describes these chemicals and lists their potential health effects: Onions are rich in two chemical groups that have perceived benefits to human health. These are the flavonoids and the alk(en)yl cysteine sulphoxides (ACSOs). […]. The ACSOs are the flavour precursors, which, when cleaved by the enzyme alliinase, generate the characteristic odour and taste of onion. The downstream products are a complex mixture of [sulfur-based compounds]. Compounds from onion have been reported to have a range of health benefits which include anticarcinogenic properties, antiplatelet activity, antithrombotic activity, antiasthmatic and antibiotic effects. Unfortunately for proponents of onion foot therapy, these potential benefits all necessitate the ingestion of these compounds, not passively leaving the entity responsible for their creation in close proximity to one’s foot. Ultimately, this kind of reasoning is a lazy distraction, equating the benefits of ingestion with other less plausible, and often undefined, pathways. While there have been some limited studies regarding some of these (ingested) benefits in laboratory settings, it needs to be noted that there has been little research definitively showing these effects on humans (though there is also a lack of research in general on the topic), per that same review: Clearly there are many claims on health benefits of Alliums [the genus that includes Onions], however, most, with the exception of garlic, have not received any rigorous (or even gentle) scientific investigation Further, the notion that these sulfur-based chemicals “release” toxins is vague oversimplification. The argument could be made that the antioxidant properties of some onion chemicals aid in the cleansing of “toxins” from your body,  but, again, you would need to be ingesting said chemicals. In the same vein as releasing toxins is the notion that the phosphoric acid found in onions cleanses your blood. The inclusion of this pro-phosphoric acid statement is odd for a David Wolfe page, given the fact that he rails against the chemical on his other pages. Though there are myriad problems with the idea that phosphoric acid cleanses your blood and with the notion that topical application of it on your foot would have any effect whatsoever, all of these issues are irrelevant as onions do not contain phosphoric acid to begin with. In fact, phosphoric acid is used in laboratory settings to liberate compounds from onions and garlic for analysis. Every so often, alarm bells are sounded on food blogs about the inclusion of phosphoric acid as a preservative in minced packages of (the closely related) garlic. Needless to say, the lack of phosphoric acid in onions is another serious blow to the proffered theories for why sock onions could have medicinal properties. In terms of the onion’s ability to boost your immune system through their antibacterial and antiviral compounds there are two ways to look at it: Yes, onions have been shown in laboratory settings to fight both viruses as well as bacteria and conceivably, these compounds could have a benefit to you — but, again, only when ingested. In this case, as well, the topical application of some chemicals in onions could kill bacteria externally. However, just as the ingestion of onions will not reduce external bacterial infections, neither will a topical application be effective at creating any change to the internal systems of one’s body, as claimed.",

        "main_text": "A common stoner trope (and a well-worn excuse for those teenagers trying to hide their stoner status from their parents) is that of the secondhand high from marijuana smoke. It is not something taken lightly by scientists, either, especially in light of a wave of marijuana legalization across the United States; studies have investigated the effects of secondhand cannabis smoke on nonsmokers for decades. While this work comes with notable limitations, the consensus is that it is, in fact, possible to get high from secondhand cannabis smoke, at least under certain extremely unventilated and confined conditions. A relevant example of such conditions — and actually a model for researchers studying the effects of second hand cannabis smoke — would be “hotboxing,” which in cannabis culture is the process of smoking marijuana with a group of people in an unventilated car or room, potentially increasing the degree to which participants are exposed to cannabis smoke. Early research sought to recreate these conditions primarily to see if people not directly smoking would absorb the active components of cannabis to the point where they could be detected in urine or blood. Though small in sample size, numerous studies conducted in the 1980s have shown that under these extreme conditions passive participants could absorb enough THC and other cannabinoids so that they could be detected in blood or urine (and, as a result, potentially affect drug screening tests for a short period of time following exposure.) A 1986 study also reported that the subjective effects of being exposed indirectly to 16 “marijuana cigarettes” were similar to those produced by directly smoking a single joint, though it bears mentioning that this 1986 marijuana was up to 10 times weaker than modern high-potency medical or recreational marijuana. The question of a second-hand high was most recently investigated in a 2015 study performed at Johns Hopkins University. Researchers confined groups of six smokers (who were each provided with ten joints) and six non-smokers in a chamber under both ventilated and unventilated conditions, letting the smokers toke at their leisure for an hour in the company of the non-smokers. Using a battery of tests following these sessions, the scientists concluded that getting high indirectly (and mildly) is possible, though dependent on how ventilated a space is: Room ventilation has a pronounced effect on exposure to secondhand cannabis smoke. Under extreme, unventilated conditions, secondhand cannabis smoke exposure can produce detectable levels of THC in blood and urine, minor physiological and subjective drug effects, and minor impairment on a task requiring psychomotor ability and working memory. The authors of the study caution that it took specific and “extreme” conditions to produce effects from the second hand high, and that their study design may not accurately reflect the real world: The size of room, amount of cannabis consumed, duration of exposure, and frequency of such exposure are all variables that likely would influence outcomes in the real world. Their results do suggest, however, that secondhand highs are possible but that you would probably have to work pretty hard to get there. That means, if you’re in a position where you’re trying to brazen out a story about how you accidentally got a contact high after a long night, you might have to think up another excuse.",

        "claim": "New Tools for Helping Heart Patients",
        "date_published": "June 21, 2010",
        "explanation": "\"This is a classic story of the potential promise of a new technology for the health care sector. A nice anecdote sets the stage and then a number of preliminary findings are used as proxies for real evidence. It is implied that the technology will keep people healthier, happier and at less cost to our costly system. This is, unfortunately, often a fairy tale mainstay of health news journalism. It’s interesting that several leading journalists wrote to us with concerns about this story. One wrote, \"\"She didn’t interview a real skeptic. It is still quite possible that these devices will only yield minor results, since heart failure is, after all, an end stage disease, so it may just be rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.\"\"\"",
        "fact_checkers": " ",
        "main_text": "\"Mixed bag. The story explained that the devices \"\"can cost as much as $30,000.\"\" And there was one data point from one study on one device that users’ hospital costs were $1,600 less per admission. But the device costs are variable and device performance will be variable. We’ll give the story the benefit of the doubt but it painted the cost picture with really broad strokes. Information about the potential to increase longevity was presented from a study that has not yet been published. The information was presented as a relative increase rather than an absolute increase. The story didn’t contain sufficient information to quantify the benefit to any specific group of patients. The story did mention the problem of potential information overload however there was no discussion of actual harm such as inappropriate shocks from implanted defibrillator devices, for example. There was no questioning of the accuracy of the data potentially transmitted by devices. This was a far too rosy picture – almost as if all the data was so terrific that the only downside could be the volume of terrific data. Other things can go wrong as past experience shows when you try to regulate the heart. In our eyes, a red flag went up when the story cited \"\"a paper under review.\"\" We don’t know the quality of the paper nor have peer reviewers completed their review yet. So that’s giving the researcher free rein to say whatever he wants about that study. We also must address the headline which stated ‘New tools for helping heart patients’ before we have concrete demonstration that the new tools actually do help. The story opened with an anecdote that implied that something terrible was avoided. That, of course, is always hard to know. The punch line is that without the device reporting in to a clinician, the situation was one in which it  \"\"could have gone for months before the problem was discovered.\"\" The story never considered the question of whether there is always value in immediate recognition of a situation. Clinicians who were involved with the makers of the devices discussed were quoted in this piece. The alternative of how things are currently done is not clear. Many involve the patient manually checking the device at home over a phone or going to the doctor. For many patients, this new technology may be of marginal benefit at unclear cost. In addition to the new devices, one needs a new system of \"\"non-visit\"\" based care and monitoring. This is something that isn’t routine in most doctors’ offices and would require changes in how they operate and in theory how they get paid. The story was a tapestry of information about devices that are currently available, devices in clinical studies, and the potential benefit from devices to be developed in the future. The story could have been clearer about products that are and are not readily available to patients. We had to read the piece several times in order to reflect on which device, from which company, was at which stage of research or development. The story wove together information from devices that available – through those used in clinical trials and those under development. Does not appear to rely on a news release.\"",

        "claim": "Temple researchers reverse cognitive impairments in mice with dementia",
        "date_published": "June 14, 2018",
        "explanation": "This news release from Temple University Health System describes a study in genetically engineered mice showing that an anti-inflammatory asthma drug was able to reverse the impact of particular kinds of brain damage associated with human Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias. The drug, an anti-leukotriene steroid called zileuton, is believed to target the biological pathways involved with damage to “tau” nerve cells in the brain. That damage leads to the fiber-like “tangles” that are suspected of sabotaging the chemical signaling between brain cells needed for learning and memory. We applaud the release for including the words “in mice” in the headline, something that our reviewers have called the university out for previously. The release would have been strengthened by explicitly addressing the long road still to travel between reversal of tau damage in designer mice and a potential treatment to restore spatial or any other kind of memory in people. A quote noting that the work “could soon be translated” to clinical use was buried at the end of the release, but still left a potentially misleading impression. It also does not mention cost or side effects. The use of  use of words like “breakthrough,” and a phrase about “new hope” for patients,  detract from the otherwise balanced release. The U.S. and world public understands the threat of Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias on aging populations. Moreover, to date, these disorders have proven resistant to virtually every medical effort to prevent or treat the devastating loss of cognitive function and overall disability that mark them. Thus, any discovery — no matter how far from actual clinical use — is often the trigger for premature enthusiasm and hype. News releases and articles therefore must do their utmost to present findings in cautious context, especially when the research described is in laboratory animals.",
        "fact_checkers": "Joann Rodgers, MS,Harold J. DeMonaco, MS,Kathlyn Stone",
        "main_text": "At this level of research, speaking to costs would seem to be unnecessary but since the drug used in the study is commercially available, the cost is relevant and should have been mentioned in the release. The drug is expensive — at $500 to $3,000 a month for asthma patients depending on insurance and co-pays — even though it’s impossible to know at this stage what  the costs or dosing would be if it is ever proven to be useful in patients with Alzheimer’s disease. Noting the cost could have been done in the context of the costs to care for someone with Alzheimer’s for years or decades. The release is light on data describing how much better at maze navigation the treated mice were compared to non-treated mice. “… significantly better on the tests…” and “…superior performance do not provide an adequate quantification of the test results. There is also a tacit and unfounded assumption that the reductions in leukotrienes and in tau are sustainable during prolonged treatment. Harms in a mouse model do not necessarily translate to humans but we do know what the side effects profile looks like. The harms include alteration of liver function, sleep and behavioral disorders — to name a few. It’s irresponsible to say that this research “could soon be translated to the clinic,” which is simply not true. There’s a tremendous gap between this research and proving clinical effectiveness. As we noted in the summary, the release should have specifically addressed the work still to do in understanding how the reversal of tau damage in designer mice translates to a potential treatment for restoring brain function in people. No mongering here. But nor does the release provide any context on the prevalence of Alzheimer’s. Funding sources are named. The release would have been improved if it had acknowledged the multiple failures over many decades of other once promising drugs for dementia tested in animals. The take-home message should be that these disorders, and brain chemistry in general, are complicated, and although research may bring hope, it has yet to bring effective treatments. The release makes the statement, albeit at the very end, that the research could “soon translate” into clinical use. That is at best misleading and provides a false hope for patients and their families, given that no timetable or process is given for what would be required to take the step to human use. A plus is that the drug already is approved for use in asthma, but it is likely that even if further animal studies confirm the current work, clinical use is still months or even years away. The release could have been improved if it noted that the current research is an extension of work done by these researchers. A 2013 publication in PLOS Medicine previously demonstrated cognitive improvements in mice treated with zileutin and alterations in levels of tau. The suggestion that this was a breakthrough seems a bit of a stretch given their previous work. Although parts of the release are cautious in describing what the drug can do, the use of words like “breakthrough” and “especially exciting” appear unwarranted.",

We've never talked to each other in 9th grade and I'm just so afraid to approach her. \n\nThis year she hangs out a lot with my friends and stuff. But still I haven't talked to her at all. One time she went over to my area with just one other friend but I just got super anxious and shy and I didn't say a thing. \n\nShe talks to my friends a lot, and I always catch myself staring at her. No one has a hint that I like her, and I'm afraid to tell people because my friends make it so obvious. I've never had any kind of relationship before, and I'm just so afraid. I think about her a lot but I have no idea how to approach her without looking to obvious that I like her and looking to creepy and emotionless. We have no classes together\nAny advice?\n\nTL;DR:",

REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson Restaurants are printing notes like this in droves, and hosts are now googling phrases like “lacto-ovo” before dinner parties. Dietary restrictions seem to grow more numerous every year, whether it’s a rise of gluten intolerance or a new low-carb low-fat no-sugar raw food diet. Good manners says to eat what you’re served, and it also says to respect the beliefs of others, and especially when you’re a host, to graciously accommodate them. Contradictory? Not if a little tact and understanding are applied. For straight-up dislikes when among friends, it’s fine to refuse a dish you don’t care for with a polite “No, thank you.” At a dinner party where the host has gone to a great deal of trouble, it’s good manners to take at least a little of every dish being offered. Teach the concept of the “no thank you helping” to children, even for family meals-it makes it easier for them when the spotlight is on them as a guest. Allergies are another matter, and can’t be avoided; your health and safety is a priority. A conscientious host will ask first-time guests if they have any particular allergies or dietary restriction. If the host doesn’t ask, it’s especially important for the guest to inform him of allergies, medical conditions, or religious prohibitions. If the gathering is small, the dinner is in your honor, or you’re going to be an overnight houseguest, however, or if you’re severely allergic to certain foods (or pets), it’s a good idea to let your host know up front when you first respond to the invitation and give him or her a chance to adjust the menu if necessary. “I’d love to come, but I should tell you that I’m completely allergic to shellfish”; “I’d love to come to the barbeque, but I should tell you that I’m a vegetarian. Could I bring a tabouleh salad if that’s okay with you?”   Always give the host the option to accommodate you or not. In some cases it may not be possible, so don’t take offense if it doesn’t work out. For a small dinner party, offer to bring a dish to share. Say: “Thanks so much for the invitation. I should let you know that I’m a vegetarian. I’d love to bring a quiche if that’s okay with you.” This way, your host won’t waste time preparing the wrong food for you or have to trouble himself figuring out what type of dish would best suit your preferences. If you’re allergic to a particular food or on a restricted diet and your host urges you to help yourself to food you know you shouldn’t or can’t eat, gently decline, “Shellfish is off-limits for me, but I’m enjoying everything else.”   It’s not necessary to inform the host of a cocktail party, large dinner party, buffet, or reception that you’re a vegetarian, mildly allergic to milk, or diabetic, because there’s bound to be a variety of foods to choose from. At the party, it’s fine to ask about the ingredients in a particular dish. When your dietary restrictions are based on religious tenets, it may not be practical to accept some invitations. If the invitation is for a small gathering, you can explain to your hostess that you’d love to accept, but that you’ll have to bring a dish that you’ve prepared according to your dietary rules-provided that’s acceptable to her. As a large part of entertaining is about being social, many hosts will encourage you to attend and bring your special dish. If you don’t drink alcohol, ask for water or a non-alcoholic beverage (which are fine to toast with should there be toasts). You don’t have to give a reason for abstaining unless you wish to. Never feel you have to drink alcohol, even if pressed. The rudeness in that case is theirs, not yours. The goal as a host is not to call special attention to guests who don’t drink alcohol. Also, be attentive to the seating arrangements. A friend in recovery shouldn’t spend the evening next to a wine aficionado extolling the virtues of every wine served.",

        "claim": "French nursing home learns costly lessons on containing coronavirus.",
        "date_published": "April 17, 2020",
        "explanation": "When managers at La Riviera nursing home on France’s Cote D’Azur found out a resident had the COVID-19 virus, they put into action a standard playbook they believed would contain the spread. It did not.",
        "fact_checkers": "Caroline Pailliez, Matthias Galante",
        "main_text": "“We kept on seeing new cases and we could not understand why,” said Antoine Ruplinger, an executive with the company that runs the home. Since then 36 residents at the home have died of coronavirus-related conditions, according to the local mayor’s office, which registers the deaths. There were 109 residents before the coronavirus crisis broke. Death rates from COVID-19 in old people’s homes around the world have been high, in part because the disease hits the elderly disproportionately and because testing at care homes has been patchy. What happened at La Riviera underlines the potential value of blanket testing at an early stage, some French officials said. “Maybe if we had been able to test from the beginning, everything would have been different,” said Florence Arnaiz-Maumé, an official with the National Union of Private Homes and Facilities for the Elderly (SYNERPA). The response by staff at La Riviera was centred around checking who was showing symptoms of infection and isolating them from the rest of the home. That was in line with national guidelines at the time, which were for only the first three suspected cases to be tested. But for over two weeks after the first case, residents in the home were not tested for COVID-19. That meant people who had the virus yet showed no symptoms were still part of the general population in the home and potentially transmitting infection. “No one had been tested, so we did not know who was infected and who wasn’t,” said Richard Galy, a medical doctor and mayor of the town of Mougins where the home is located. France last week changed its policy, so that all nursing home residents and staff are tested at those homes where a COVID-19 case has been detected, whether or not they are showing symptoms. Twenty days after the first case, systematic testing of residents for COVID-19 began at La Riviera on April 4. Thirty-three residents were found to be carrying the virus, as well as 14 staff, who were sent home. The testing allowed the home to put in place a new virus containment plan, guided by an infectious disease specialist from a nearby hospital. Those who tested positive have been put on the first and second floors of the complex. They are cared for by staff who do not mix with other patients, and who use their own dedicated elevator, changing rooms and break rooms. Engineers have visited to make sure there is negative pressure inside rooms with coronavirus patients, so when a door is opened, air does not stream out, spreading the infection. By the time it became clear that the virus was spreading after the first case of COVID-19 at the home was identified in mid-March, Galy had been in touch for days with staff at the home, public health officials, and regional officials. Galy said he knew about the deaths, and was urging immediate testing. But tests were not available. The company that usually does testing for the Riviera, laboratoire de L’Esperance, only had enough kits to do 80 tests per day and priority was given to hospitals, healthcare workers, and people with symptoms, said the head of the laboratory, Dr Françoise Duhalde-Guignard. “So at the time, we couldn’t test,” she told Reuters. The regional public health authority said it has launched an investigation into why so many people died at the home. The authority has said the home’s managers waited too long to seek help. The home’s operator, Korian SA, said its staff acted in line with official guidance, and sought help when it was necessary. The mayor and four families of La Riviera residents have joined a legal case brought by some of the families against unidentified individuals alleging involuntary homicide, endangerment of life, and failure to assist a person in danger. The mayor said he was joining because he wanted to understand better what happened and where the responsibility for what happened lay. Korian and the public health authority both declined to comment on the legal case. The first case at the home was identified on March 15, when a local hospital treating a resident informed the home that the person had tested positive for COVID-19. Ruplinger, the executive with the home’s operator, received a call about the case just before midnight. The next morning, he arrived at La Riviera. He ordered that staff were to wear protective gear at all times, cleaning was to be stepped up and residents were to be confined to their rooms. Residents suspected of having the virus were moved to an 11-bed unit on a separate floor. Within three days of opening, the segregation unit had run out of beds. Several residents had already died, according to Magali Lamoureux, who runs a local funeral home and was called by the home to collect some of the bodies. She said death certificates listed COVID-19 as the cause of death. By the time testing did happen, it was too late for patients like Odette Noyer, who arrived there around 18 months ago from the town of Romans-sur-Iseres, about 400 km (250 miles) north. On March 24, she marked her 94th birthday and her family, who lived nearby, spoke to her by telephone to congratulate her. Six days later, her grandson rang the home at 5 pm to ask after her, according to a legal complaint filed by the family of Noyer and several other residents, which was seen by Reuters. A member of staff said she was being administered oxygen, but was fine. At 10 pm the same night, she died.",

        "date_published": "June 6, 2014",
        "explanation": "Fighting obesity by taxing sugary drinks and restricting junk food advertisements aimed at children has support from a wide majority of residents surveyed in a Southern California public health study released on Thursday.",
        "fact_checkers": "Jennifer Chaussee",
        "main_text": "The findings from the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health come as friction mounts between the beverage industry and health advocates over the best way to fight obesity and diabetes, tied by studies to over-consumption of soda, sweets and junk food. “There have been a lot of arguments against this sort of policy,” including claims it will cost the poor more to buy food, said Paul Simon, head of chronic disease prevention for the county and lead author of the study. But Simon said nearly two-thirds of those surveyed by the county in a broad 2011 assessment of public attitudes toward health issues, said they supported a soda tax, and three-quarters favored limiting junk food advertising. Public health advocates across the country have clamored for ways to reduce consumption of sugary drinks and junk food, but lawmakers and voters have generally opposed enacting taxes or other regulations. Lawmakers in Illinois rejected a measure in late May that would have taxed soda purchases at one cent per ounce, and a tax proposed for California failed in the state Legislature last year. On Wednesday, an attorney for New York City asked the state’s top court to revive the city’s ban on large sugary drinks, which was overturned by a lower court last year. In California, a measure to require warning labels on sodas passed the state Senate last week. The industry association CalBev downplayed the Los Angeles survey and other polls showing support for such restrictions. “A polling question asked in a vacuum without any context often gives the impression that voters support these types of taxes, but the reality is when you put it directly to the voters they always go down in defeat,” the association said Thursday. Simon and his colleagues analyzed data from a survey of about 1,000 Los Angeles County adults called randomly by telephone. They found support for such restrictions to be highest among low-income residents, whose obesity and diabetes rates are highest. “It’s described as regressive, that it would discriminate against poorer people because they have less money,” Simon said. “Nonetheless we found in our study that there is more support among those groups.”",

Simply put, though phytoestrogens do interact with the human body in ways that disrupt estrogen-controlled processes, their effect in almost all cases is much less pronounced than that of actual estrogens. For this reason, Stangle’s comparison of “estrogen” levels in Impossible Whoppers and birth control pills, which contain synthetic estrogen compounds, is problematic.",

        "main_text": "On Dec. 20, 2019, the livestock industry publication Tri-State Livestock News published a wide-ranging screed against the Impossible Whopper, the livestock-free substitute burger sold at Burger King. The author of the article, South Dakota veterinarian James Stangle, made a series of dubious assertions to arrive at the conclusion that four Impossible Whoppers per day contain “enough estrogen to grow boobs on a male.” For several reasons articulated below, this conclusion is flawed. Strictly speaking, Impossible Burgers, which use soy as their protein, have no estrogen in them whatsoever. Estrogen refers to a group of sex hormones created by an animal’s endocrine system that affect myriad reproductive and other bodily processes. These chemicals, the most significant of which is estradiol, are not found in any plant-based product, including the soy protein of Impossible Whoppers. When people express concern about “estrogen” in soy products, they are actually expressing concern about phytoestrogens — a class of compounds structurally similar to but nonetheless different from estrogens. In soy products, the most relevant chemicals meeting this description are known as isoflavones. Though Stangle devotes ample space to the lesson “not all proteins are created equal,” he frequently relies on the demonstrably false assumption that phytoestrogens and estrogens are equal in terms of their effect on hormonally mediated processes.",

        "date_published": "September 4, 2016",
        "explanation": "But none of the leads we’ve followed converge on a single source, much less an authoritative one. There doesn’t seem to be a source. It’s just “that story about that time Hillary Clinton got schooled by Mother Teresa” people tell at pro-life events. It is told consistently, mind you — apart from small details — but such is the case with most anecdotes this pointed and this short, regardless of whether they’re true or false. Until we encounter a citation that names an eyewitness source — or, better yet, quotes one.",
        "fact_checkers": "David Emery",
        "main_text": "In a Vatican ceremony on 4 September 2016, Pope Francis conferred sainthood upon Mother Teresa, the Albanian-born nun who famously devoted most of her life to ministering to the poor in India until her death in 1997 at the age of 87. He described her as a “model of holiness” and “generous dispenser of divine mercy,” citing, among other qualifications, Mother Teresa’s unwavering opposition to abortion in any form. “She was committed to defending life,” the Pope said, “ceaselessly proclaiming that ‘the unborn are the weakest, the smallest, the most vulnerable. '” For Americans, the canonization of Mother Teresa coincided with the home stretch of the 2016 presidential campaign, in which the two principal candidates, along with their parties, have taken opposite stands on the issue of abortion. Republican Donald Trump has declared himself “pro-life” and supports legal sanctions to “protect the unborn,” while Democrat Hillary Clinton says she’s committed to protecting “women’s access to critical health services, including safe, legal abortion.” The timing of the resurrection of an old anecdote about a meeting between Hillary Clinton and Mother Teresa — an anecdote some have called “apocryphal” even while passing it along — was probably not so coincidental. Most versions tie the story to a National Prayer Breakfast hosted by the Clinton administration in 1994, at which Mother Teresa was invited to speak and did not mince words about her feelings on abortion: The greatest destroyer of peace today is abortion, because it is a war against the child, a direct killing of the innocent child, murder by the mother herself. And if we accept that a mother can kill even her own child, how can we tell other people not to kill one another? How do we persuade a woman not to have an abortion? As always, we must persuade her with love and we remind ourselves that love means to be willing to give until it hurts. Jesus gave even His life to love us. So, the mother who is thinking of abortion, should be helped to love, that is, to give until it hurts her plans, or her free time, to respect the life of her child. The father of that child, whoever he is, must also give until it hurts. By abortion, the mother does not learn to love, but kills even her own child to solve her problems. And, by abortion, that father is told that he does not have to take any responsibility at all for the child he has brought into the world. The father is likely to put other women into the same trouble. So abortion just leads to more abortion. Any country that accepts abortion is not teaching its people to love, but to use any violence to get what they want. This is why the greatest destroyer of love and peace is abortion. After the speech, Mother Teresa and First Lady Hillary Clinton — who, needless to say, held disparate opinions on the topic of the day — briefly conversed, as recalled by Clinton in her 2003 memoir, Living History: She had just delivered a speech against abortion, and she wanted to talk to me. Mother Teresa was unerringly direct. She disagreed with my views on a woman’s right to choose and told me so. Over the years, she sent me dozens of notes and messages with the same gentle entreaty. Mother Teresa never lectured or scolded me; her admonitions were always loving and heartfelt. I had the greatest respect for her opposition to abortion, but I believe that it is dangerous to give any state the power to enforce criminal penalties against women & doctors. I consider that a slippery slope to state control in China & Communist Romania. I also disagreed with her opposition — and that of the Catholic Church — to birth control. However, I support the right of people of faith to speak out against abortion and try to dissuade women, without coercion or criminalization, from choosing abortion instead of adoption. Mother Teresa and I found much common ground in many other areas including the importance of adoption. According to the anecdote that concerns us today, there was another verbal back-and-forth between Clinton and Mother Teresa on that occasion (or perhaps it was another occasion — there are varying versions of events), which began with the First Lady quizzing the future saint about, of all things, gender and politics: “Why do you think we haven’t had a woman as president yet?” First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton asked her guest over their lunch at the White House. The little woman sitting at table with Mrs. Clinton did not hesitate in her reply. “Because she has probably been aborted,” said Mother Teresa. It’s an exchange Hillary Clinton would vividly remember, one would think, yet she neglected to mention it in her memoir, nor has she ever spoken of it in public speeches or interviews. It doesn’t appear in biographies of Clinton or Mother Teresa. (The question of why the U.S. hadn’t yet seen a woman as president also seems a rather implausible query for Hillary Clinton to have posed to a conservative Albanian-Indian Roman Catholic nun.) The source most frequently cited by those spreading the story during the 2016 presidential campaign is an essay by educator Sean Fitzpatrick that appeared in the Catholic journal Crisis Magazine on 20 January 2016. Fitzpatrick used the anecdote as an epigraph without specifying where he found it. When we contacted him and asked for his help to authenticate it, Fitzpatrick replied that he has heard it told on many occasions over the years but doesn’t know of a definitive source. He pointed us to a few other iterations of the tale online, however, which at least led a few years further back, such as this variant published in the Evansville, Indiana Courier & Press on 11 March 2010: Many years ago there was a large dinner party at the White House. At one end of the table there were two distinguished women carrying on a conversation. At one point in the conversation, one woman looked at the other and asked a simple question, “Why do you think in the United States of America with all of our liberties and all of our freedoms, we have never elected a female president?” The other woman, without looking up from her meal and with a very calm look on her face said, “Because you probably aborted her.” The woman who asked that question that day was then First Lady Hillary Clinton. The woman who answered that question was Mother Teresa. In this case, as in some others we found, the storyteller was identified as pro-life activist Shawn Carney, though we’ve no reason to think the story originated with him. It appears, in fact, to be standard fare at pro-life gatherings. Here is a mention from October 2010: We attended our annual banquet for Pregnancy Resources Center last night. The speaker recounted a conversation between two women several years ago in Washington DC who were attending the national prayer breakfast. One of the women, Hillary Clinton, said, “You know, I wonder why we have never elected a woman president?”  The other woman, Mother Teresa, said, “Maybe it is because you aborted her.” We haven’t yet come across any instances of the story being told before 2009, however. One of the earliest examples is in a blog post written by Ohio Congressman Steve Chabot in October of that year: Now I agree with [Anita Dunn] on the pro-life crusader Mother Teresa, who reportedly when then Senator Hilary Clinton wondered why America had never had a woman President was rebuked by the diminutive nun as follows: “You probably aborted her.”",

        "date_published": "January 13, 2014",
        "explanation": "Lexicon Pharmaceuticals Inc said its chief executive would leave and it would cut its workforce by about 45 percent, as it moves its focus away from drug discovery to completing the studies of its drugs in late-stage development.",
        "fact_checkers": "Vrinda Manocha",
        "main_text": "Lexicon shares, which have lost about 15 percent of their value last year, fell as much as 7.5 percent to $1.85 on the Nasdaq in early trading on Monday. The company said Arthur Sands, CEO since 1995 and a co-founder, intends to develop a succession plan with the board. He will continue in his position until a successor is appointed. Analysts said Sands might have been perceived as more of a scientist who would not be able to lead the company into a commercial launch of the late-stage drugs. “I think Arthur Sands could have easily done the transition to commercial, but possibly the board felt they wanted someone with direct commercial experience”, Wedbush analyst Liana Moussatos said. Lexicon said it would cut 115 jobs, primarily positions in research and discovery, to reduce costs. The company said it would focus mainly on its drugs to treat diabetes and carcinoid syndrome, a condition which affects some people with a rare cancerous tumor. “Most of the value of the company is wrapped up in these late-stage drugs,” Morningstar analyst Karen Andersen said. “It makes sense to focus on what investors are really looking at.”  Lexicon said it expects to lower expenses by about $14 million, net of severance costs and some other charges, for the rest of 2014. It expects to save about $22 million annually. “This could give them an extra two to three quarters of cash,” Moussatos said. The company had $151.2 million in cash and investments as of September 30 last year. Andersen said Lexicon needed to conserve cash while it looked for a partner to fund the development of its diabetes drug. “In order to do a comprehensive diabetes program, it takes hundreds of millions of dollars, which is more than Lexicon can afford right now,” she said. The company is testing two other drugs in mid-stage trials to treat irritable bowel syndrome and rheumatoid arthritis. It also has a glaucoma drug in early-stage development. Moussatos said that Lexicon could license the development of the drugs to other pharmaceutical companies. Lexicon has drug discovery agreements with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, Roche Holding AG’s unit Genentech and Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd.  Lexicon shares, which once traded above $40, were down 4.5 percent at $1.91.",

        "date_published": "June 9, 2009",
        "explanation": "Just as cosmetic treatments provide the appearance of youth, without actually offering any real health benefits, this story appears to be about a new laser device intended to reduce wrinkles, but it fails to provide viewers with meaningful information about the device or how it compares to alternative procedures. The fault is not entirely that of the reporters; the manufacturer put out a news release announcing FDA approval of the device, but then refused to give out any further details. Of course, the journalists could have decided not to do the story at all. Gertrude Stein said of Oakland, “when you get there, there isn’t any there there.” With its lack of useful information about the laser device, the same could be said of this story that isn’t a story.",
        "fact_checkers": " ",
        "main_text": "This story barely meets the criterion. It discusses costs, and does a good job of emphasizing that most treatments that reduce the appearance of wrinkles have only temporary effects and need to be repeated indefinitely, often at great cost. However, it lacks specific figures about the cost of the new laser device. The story does emphasize that the effects of this device are much smaller than those of cosmetic treatments offered by dermatologists; but the magnitude of the difference is not defined. Also, this statement is made without reference to any evidence to support a conclusion about the relative effectiveness of the device compared to established procedures. The dermatologist quoted in the story says, “I think you’re looking at a device that’s going to only produce a single digit fraction of results as compared to what you can get in a dermatologist’s office.” The meaning of “a single digit fraction” is a mystery left unanswered in this story. The medical correspondent states the obvious by pointing out that a device used at home would be more convenient than going to a physician for treatment. Although the headline of this story is about a home laser device, there is almost no discussion of the device itself. A dermatologist warns against a tendency to “over-abuse and overuse,” but these terms are not defined. No evidence is discussed. Indeed, the manufacturer refused requests from other news organizations for details about the device, so there are no facts to report. What’s more, when discussing laser treatments done by a dermatologist, the correspondent relies on a single set of before-and-after photographs of a patient, without making reference to any controlled trials or other scientific evidence. The story repeatedly confuses wrinkles with aging. Wrinkles are not a disease. Treatments that reduce the appearance of wrinkles have no effect on the underlying process of aging… or of certain conditions that affect the appearance of the skin. A person who has wrinkles burned or scrubbed away or disguised by cosmetic treatments is no younger or healthier than someone who covers up the wrinkles with make-up. This story feeds misconceptions about health and aging. In an odd reversal of the usual pattern of stories that fail to meet this criterion, this report included only doctors who were independent of the company marketing this laser device. There was no interview or other information that came from anyone with first-hand knowledge of the device, how it was tested, or what results it has demonstrated in trials. Viewers were left to figure out on their own that the dermatologist interviewed for this story has a vested interest in persuading people to pay him or his colleagues for treatment, rather than trying an over-the-counter device. There were no quotes or statements from professional societies, public agencies, or others who could offer an independent overview of the pros and cons of the new device. Most of this report is about alternative procedures, so it would seem to meet this criterion. However, the lack of information about the new device makes any meaningful comparisons impossible. This one is a close call. The story does state that the device has received FDA approval, but is not yet available. However, the absence of any detail about device or the manufacturer leaves viewers in the dark. There are other devices available to consumers that use “light therapy” to affect the appearance of the skin. Since this story provided no information about the recently-approved device, it is impossible to tell whether or how it may be different from competing products. By looking at other sources, it does appear that this device is the first laser specifically approved for over-the-counter treatment of wrinkles; but this distinction is not clear from viewing the story. The story included an interview with a dermatologist and does not appear to rely only on a news release.",

Which this one doesn’t, as they often don’t. We also didn’t hear anything about why we don’t jump to conclusions after studies in just 27 people. And why was the pig research thrown in?

        "main_text": "\"No discussion of costs – a recurring and significant oversight. The claims of \"\"100% accuracy\"\" and that \"\"The investigators found that after just one laser treatment, misfiring ceased in 84 percent of the treated veins, and 90 percent remained inactive three months after treatment\"\" aren’t put into any meaningful context about what difference this made in patient outcomes. Of course, what can you possibly say about outcomes after just three months? Which is exactly the point of raising this issue at all. No discussion of harms. No discussion of the limitations of drawing conclusions from a study of just 27 people. No explanation of whether destroying misfiring cells with \"\"100% accuracy\"\" actually makes a difference in people’s lives and outcomes. No overt disease mongering. However, to say that \"\"about 2.2 million Americans currently live with an irregular heartbeat condition, known as atrial fibrillation\"\" in the same breath as describing a study of just 27 people may imply that this very small study has immediate ramifications for all 2.2 million. And it does not. Barely satisfactory. There’s actually no interview – only a rehash of what was published in a journal, restated from a news release. No independent source cited. Again, the comparison of the \"\"new approach\"\" with existing approaches is superficial and unhelpful. And there was no comparison of performance or outcomes data. Terribly incomplete on this point. It is never made clear whether the device and approach are still experimental or already in clinical use. The word \"\"new\"\" was used five times in the short story. Yet the real novelty of this approach is only scantily and insufficiently described – especially if the implication is that this has relevance for 2.2 million Americans. The story admits it’s based on an American Heart Association news release. There’s no sign of any independent reporting or vetting.\"",

It seems as if he wanted to put enough effort into it, but didn't have the time or the skills.\n\nI send an email to inform them that he didn't contributed that much. Today we had to present/defend our project and they asked some normal questions about the project to gauge the situation. He couldn't answer them correctly.

        "main_text": "In June 2019, tens of millions of Facebook users watched and shared a viral video that purported to demonstrate “16 easy tests” to determine whether certain foods and drinks were “fake” or “real.” The video was posted on 1 June by Blossom, a digital publishing brand that creates viral content, often in the form of “listicles” — “8 ways to transform and upgrade your wardrobe,” “3 oddly satisfying stress relievers,” “4 super cool ways to use ice cube trays,” and so on. Within a few days, viewers shared the video more than 3 million times and viewed it more than 85 million times. However, it was removed from Facebook by 10 June 2019, after this fact check was originally published. The video purported to show short clips of DIY food “experiments,” along with subtitles that add a degree of detail:  ﻿ The 16 tests outlined in the video constituted a mixture of falsehoods, recycled urban myths, one or two experiments that have a grain of truth to them, and several tests that address types of adulteration that are absent from the United States and many other countries but have been reported in India and parts of the developing world. On the whole, the video served its viewers poorly as a source of reliable information about food safety and adulteration. In a statement sent in response to the spread of the video, a spokesperson for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) told Snopes: Federal law requires that food is safe and properly labeled. For example, all food additives and color additives must be approved by FDA before market entry, and the labeling of food must be truthful and not misleading. We take food contamination and fraud very seriously and do take action when problems arise, especially if it appears that the adulteration was intentional. Consumers should rest assured that most of the practices illustrated in this video are not legal in the U.S. and any FDA-regulated product that violates or appears to the violate the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, may be subject to seizure, mandatory recall, or other enforcement action … Consumers should be able to trust that the foods they eat are safe and videos like these can undermine the confidence consumers have in the FDA’s role in maintaining the safety our food supply … For its part, First Media, the company that operates the Blossom brand, told us via a spokesperson: “The video does not claim that all products or specific manufacturers include these materials, nor does it make any health or nutritional suggestions or recommendations. They are demonstrations of things we consider to be important for our global audience, however this content is intended only for informational purposes and as entertainment.” We sent the video and its 16 claims to Eric Decker, head of the Department of Food Science in the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, one of the leading academic food science programs in the United States. Here is our breakdown of the 16 tests, based on Decker’s assessments and the supporting evidence provided to Snopes by First Media. 1. “Processed cheese with chemicals is difficult to melt”: FALSE  The claim that processed cheese is hard to melt is an old one, and a subject we have previously examined in detail. It first emerged in late 2014 when internet users began posting videos of themselves setting fire to slices of American cheese in an effort to prove that the cheese was “fake.” When asked for supporting evidence, a spokesperson for First Media directed us to a 2015 Vice News article and wrote: “Processed cheese contains an added ingredient known as ‘Emulsifying Salt’ which is known to ‘help bind fats, proteins, and water in cheese. '” Interestingly, the Vice article that First Media relied on as evidence carried the headline “Stop Setting Your Cheese on Fire” and warned: “Videos purporting to demonstrate the evil stuff in processed cheese have started making the rounds online. Problem is, they don’t prove anything except how little we know about our food.” In response to this section of the video, Decker told us: “That’s exactly the opposite of reality … There are additives that are added to processed cheese to help the cheese melt … They take real cheese and they add what they call chelating salts and things like citric acid. That helps break the protein [casein] down. The protein in regular cheese is very aggregated together. So when you melt it, you see these clumps. If you can get those proteins to come apart, then it’s much easier to melt the cheese.” [Emphasis is added]. 2. “Rice is mixed with plastic bits to increase manufacturer profit”: FALSE  This is another canard. Every so often, for the best part of the past decade, highly questionable and thinly sourced reports have been emerging from China and other Asian countries, as well as parts of Africa, claiming widespread adulteration of rice with plastic. So far, no reliable corroboration of those claims exists, which have caused panic in some countries and have been confirmed as hoaxes. If you add plastic to rice and then cook that mixture, you might be able to identify the plastic by its melting, turning clear, or sticking to the frying pan. But no reliable evidence exists that such rice is bought or sold anywhere in the world (not least the United States) in the first place. When asked by Snopes, First Media declined to say how and where they obtained the rice shown in the video, and whether they had added anything to the rice before filming this portion of the video. 3. ‘Baby food contains ground-up rocks advertised as fortified calcium’: UNPROVEN  First Media told us this test was based on one included in a similar 2015 video, which can be viewed here. However, that video purportedly showed a magnet being used to locate and extract iron filings, not calcium, in baby food. We put that discrepancy to First Media, but they declined to clarify what their video actually showed, and also refused to say how and where they had obtained the baby food purportedly shown in the video or whether they had added anything to it before filming. Either way, the video is framed in a highly misleading way, describing fortified calcium as “ground-up rocks.” Calcium, an earth metal, can be found naturally in rocks and other components of the earth’s surface, especially in limestone. On this subject, Decker told us that most supplemental calcium was ultimately derived from a rock. “That’s what’s in lime [stone]. You can get calcium that comes from oyster shells, you can get calcium that comes from all different sources.” He said the description of fortified calcium as “ground-up rocks” was “very misleading.” “The calcium they put in baby food would be no different than what they put in any food.” 4. “Synthetic supplements burn! Natural supplements won’t!”: FALSE  “That’s just bullshit,” Decker told us. “There’s just no basis to any of that. Most synthetic supplements are chemically identical to natural supplements.” In response to our request for supporting evidence, First Media directed us to another questionable 2015 video, which can be viewed here. That video also showed a tray of supplements — both capsules and tablets — baked in an oven. Those that burned or melted were identified as synthetic, those that did not were identified as natural. When asked by us, First Media refused to identify the supplements shown in their own video, and refused to say where and how they had obtained them. 5. ‘Glue’ in meat: MOSTLY TRUE  This section has to do with something called transglutaminase, which the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) describes as “an enzyme approved for use as a binder to form smaller cuts of meat into a larger serving of meat. It is a natural substance derived from fermented bacteria …” Transglutaminase is sometimes colloquially referred to as “meat glue,” but First Media’s video had the potential to cause unnecessary alarm or misinformation by describing it simply as “glue,” raising the specter of synthetic acrylic and epoxy glues being surreptitiously embedded in meat products. We can’t verify that what is shown in the video is in fact meat glue, but we do know that transglutaminase is regarded as safe by U.S. federal authorities. According to the USDA, “TG enzyme is a food binder that has been used in meat and poultry products for over 10 years. It was determined to be generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1998 for use to improve texture and cooking yields in various standardized meat and poultry products and as a protein cross-linking agent to fabricate or reform cuts of meat.” 6. Washing powder is added to ice cream “for shine and lightness”: FALSE  As evidence in relation to this section of the video, First Media sent Snopes a link to a 2018 post on a relatively obscure Indian blog which claimed that ice cream is sometimes adulterated with “Detergents or washing powder to improve smoothness and induce frothing thereby adding to the volume.” The warning appears to have originated with speeches and checklists prepared in 2012 and 2013 by Sitaram Dixit, then chairman of a non-profit organization called the Consumer Guidance Society of India. In a 2013 document, Dixit outlined two tests for determining the presence of washing powder in ice cream: “1. Put some lemon juice [in the ice cream], bubbles are observed if washing powder is present. 2. Add 1 ml of Hydrochloric acid (HCl) to a little of [sic] Sugar. If you observe effervescence, then washing powder is present.” Despite this warning, no evidence exists of a pattern of behavior whereby retailers or manufacturers do, in fact, add washing powder or detergent to ice cream in order to add to its frothiness. We found no specific reports of any such incidents, either from India or elsewhere. In the context of the United States, we checked the FDA database of product-complaint reports from 2004 to 2018, and found not a single report of washing powder or detergent having been added to ice cream, or any other food or beverage product. First Media’s video might well show lemon juice being added to a mixture of ice cream and washing powder. (The company again refused to say where they obtained the ice cream shown in the video and whether they had added anything to it before filming.) However, the underlying premise of this experiment — that manufacturers or retailers do, in fact, add washing powder to ice cream “for shine and lightness” — is false. Most of the remaining 10 claims can be traced back to guidelines published in 2015 by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), a legitimate statutory agency operating under the aegis of India’s Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and the Indian government. Food adulteration is a serious and widespread problem in India, to an extent that is not replicated in the United States and many other developed countries. Some of the remaining tests in the Blossom video were based on scientifically valid experiments, but they had to do with types of food and drink adulteration that either simply do not occur, or are not prevalent in the United States and many other countries. Although Blossom has an international audience, the brand served its viewers — particularly those living outside India — poorly by failing to mention any of that crucial context. 7. Milk is adulterated with rice water, but will turn blue in the presence of seaweed: MIXTURE  This test can be traced to the FSSAI guidelines, known as “Detect Adulteration with Rapid Test” (DART), which set out the following method: “Boil 2-3 ml of sample with 5ml of water. Cool and add 2-3 drops of tincture of iodine. Formation of blue colour indicates the presence of starch. (In the case of milk, addition of water and boiling is not required)”. As First Media explained to us by email, they used seaweed in their test because it is a good source of iodine. We haven’t been able to verify the iodine content of the particular seaweed they used, nor the composition of the milk samples featured in the videos. (The company refused to say where they obtained the milk or whether they added anything to it before filming, and they declined to answer a question about the prevalence of starch adulteration of milk in the United States.) However, the test is at least based on an FSSAI experiment that is scientifically legitimate, as confirmed by Decker. Nonetheless, it is a test that addresses a type of adulteration (starch in milk) that is not prevalent in the United States and many other developed countries. By failing to provide that crucial context, this section of the video presented a highly misleading impression to tens of millions of viewers. 8. “Old produce is often dyed to make it look fresh” (and rubbing it with oil and water will reveal the deception): MIXTURE  This test also originates in the FSSAI guidelines, which set out the following method: “Take a cotton ball soaked in water or vegetable oil. (conduct the test separately). Rub the outer red surface of the sweet potato. If cotton absorbs colour, then it indicates the usage of rhodamine B for colouring the outer surface of sweet potato.” Clearly, food products in India feature color additives such as rhodamine B to an extent or frequency that warrants the intervention of the FSSAI. However, the same is not true in the United States. Since 1983, the FDA has banned the two types of rhodamine B for use in drugs and cosmetics due to their carcinogenic properties. Since rhodamine B is not affirmatively listed as safe for use in food, it is therefore also effectively banned for use in food. For that reason, food manufacturers — subject to FDA inspections and fearful of punishment for violating food safety regulations — don’t use rhodamine B. In rare cases when they do, the FDA takes action against them. In light of these facts, it’s not clear where or how First Media obtained the sweet potato shown in the video, or whether they added anything to it before filming. 9. “Coffee with additives floats, pure coffee sinks”: UNPROVEN  This test can also ultimately be traced back to the FSSAI guidelines, but those guidelines set out methods to test for the presence of two specific substances apparently used in India to adulterate coffee: clay and chicory powder. In testing for clay, the FSSAI advised, “Add ½ teaspoon of coffee powder in a transparent glass of water. Stir for a minute and keep it aside for 5 minutes. Observe the glass at the bottom. Pure coffee powder will not leave any clay particles at the bottom. If coffee powder is adulterated, clay particles will settle at the bottom.” In the illustration used to demonstrate the clay test, the unadulterated coffee floats on the surface of the glass of water, something Blossom claimed was characteristic of adulterated coffee:  In testing for the presence of chicory powder, the FSSAI guidelines advised: “Take a transparent glass of water. Add a teaspoon of coffee powder. Coffee powder floats over the water but chicory begins to sink.” Here once again, the illustration shows pure coffee as floating on the surface of the water, while the chicory-adulterated coffee sinks. This is the opposite of what Blossom’s video claimed when it stated “pure coffee sinks.” For these reasons, among others, this particular test should not be considered reliable. We asked First Media to specify the kinds of additives that were tested in its video, but we did not receive a response to that particular question. 10. Fake salt contains chalk and turns water cloudy: MIXTURE  Again, the practice of adulterating salt with chalk is one primarily seen in India. We could find no evidence of such a practice in the United States. As such, the “chalk in salt” test derives from the FSSAI guidelines, which outline the following advice: “Stir a spoonful of sample of salt in a glass of water. The presence of chalk will make [the] solution white and other insoluble impurities will settle down.” 11. “Old split peas are coated in green dye to disguise them”: MIXTURE  It’s not clear how widespread the practice of adding green coloring to split peas is, but it has featured in unconfirmed news reports emanating from China and India, and it has also been the subject of viral hoaxes in India. It appears to be prevalent enough in India that the FSSAI included it in some guidelines, advising: “Detection of artificial colour on green peas: Take little amount of green peas in a transparent glass. Add water to it and mix well. Let it stand for half an hour. Clear separation of colour in water indicates adulteration.” However, no evidence shows that the practice is prevalent in the United States or other developed countries. Furthermore, it’s not clear that Blossom’s video actually shows green dye being removed from split peas, as opposed to the process of chlorophyll degradation, which occurs naturally when green split peas are exposed to the heat of boiling water. 12. “Pure spices burn and ignite, impure spices don’t”: UNPROVEN  This claim too can be traced back to the FSSAI guidelines, but those guidelines specifically related to asafoetida, a gum that is used widely in Indian cuisine. By contrast, the Blossom video referred only to “spices,” and showed a spoonful of turmeric. The FSSAI guidelines advised: “Detection of foreign resin in asafoetida: Burn small quantity of asafoetida in a stainless steel spoon. Pure asafoetida will burn like camphor [a flammable wax]. Adulterated asafoetida will not produce bright flame like camphor.” While asafoetida adulteration might well be prevalent in India, and lighting a flame under a spoonful of it might indeed be a scientifically valid means of determining whether the asafoetida contains adulterants, it simply cannot be assumed that the same test works for other spices. As Decker observed: “Trying to extend that test to turmeric isn’t necessarily accurate, because those two spices have very different compositions.” We asked First Media for a list of spices to which the “flame” test applied, but we did not receive a response to that question. 13. Some honey is diluted with water and diluted honey extinguishes a flame in a candle wick: MOSTLY TRUE  This test also originates in the FSSAI guidelines, which state: “Take a cotton wick dipped in a pure honey and light with a match stick. Pure honey will burn. If adulterated, the presence of water will not allow the honey to burn. If it does, it will produce a cracking sound.” The FSSAI test appears to be valid, and appears to have been replicated by the makers of the video. However, it’s worth noting that in the context of the United States, the primary way in which honey is adulterated is by being mixed with corn syrup or cane sugar, not by being diluted with water. In light of that fact, it’s not clear where First Media obtained diluted honey, or whether they themselves added water to pure honey before filming. 14. “Pure tea doesn’t stain, impure tea stains instantly”: MIXTURE  Black teas get their characteristic dark colors from the tannins they contain. As such, even unadulterated tea might leave a stain, as anyone who has dropped a tea bag on to a garment or piece of paper can attest. However, the FSSAI guidelines do contain a test that is designed to determine not just whether a tea is “impure,” as the video ambiguously claims, but specifically whether old tea leaves have been artificially colored with coal-tar dye: “Detection of exhausted tea in tea leaves: Take a filter paper and spread [a] few tea leaves. Sprinkle with water to wet the filter paper. Wash the filter paper under tap water and observe the stains against light. Pure tea leaves will not stain the filter paper. If coal tar is present, it will immediately stain the filter paper.” We asked First Media to clarify what they meant by “impure” tea, but we did not receive a response to that question. As such, we cannot evaluate the validity or reliability of the test shown in the video. 15. ‘If butter contains oil, added sugar will turn pink’: UNPROVEN  First Media cited a source that claimed: “Add a pinch of sugar to a teaspoon of melted ghee in a bottle. Shake well. Check it after 5 minutes, if you see the colour change to red, then it contains vegetable oil.” That purported test can ultimately be traced back to a document published by Dixit, the former chairman of the Consumer Guidance Society of India, whose claims formed the basis of the “washing powder in ice cream” test above. Dixit outlined an experiment for determining the presence of vanaspati, a kind of vegetable shortening, in butter or ghee (clarified butter): “Take one teaspoonful of melted ghee or butter with equal quantity of Conc. Hydrochloric acid in a test tube. Add to it a pinch of cane sugar. Shake well for one minute and let it stand for five minutes. Crimson red colour in lower layer shows the presence of Vanaspati.” First Media’s video claimed only that the presence of “oil” (presumed to be vegetable oil) would cause sugar to turn pink in butter. However, the source the company cited and the original source both claimed the sugar would turn red, not pink, and the original source said the sugar would turn “crimson red,” and only after the inclusion of concentrated hydrochloric acid in the mixture. Without any further details about the precise ingredients and process employed by First Media (which the company failed to provide), and in light of these discrepancies, we can’t draw any definitive conclusions about the validity of the test shown in the video. 16. Some fresh produce is coated in wax, and warm water removes the wax: TRUE  This is the only clearly accurate claim in the video. We can’t say for certain that what is shown in the video is indeed wax being removed from a bell pepper by warm water, but there’s no doubt that producers and retailers do sometimes apply wax coatings to fruit and vegetables, as Decker outlined: “That’s common. Vegetables are waxed a lot. The main purposes of waxing the vegetable, one of them is to give it that shiny appearance, but the other one is to prevent moisture loss.” So the application of a thin coating of wax is a real phenomenon, as the video states, but this doesn’t indicate that the food is “fake” — rather, it’s a safe, FDA-approved way to help the produce look shinier and last longer. As Decker observed: “All these waxes are edible, anyway. They’re approved food additives.”",

Of these two options I personally prefer nginx it is robust and lightweight and completely fit for purpose .

        "fact_checkers": "Nate Raymond, Jonathan Stempel",
        "main_text": "The decision by Cleveland County District Judge Thad Balkman in Norman, Oklahoma, came in the first case to go to trial out of 2,700 nationally by states, counties and cities seeking to hold drug companies responsible for the deadly epidemic. Balkman reduced the amount he had awarded in August by $107 million after agreeing with New Brunswick, New Jersey-based J&J that he had made a math error. J&J said it will appeal, and that the award and finding of liability were “neither supported by the facts nor the law.”  A spokesman for Oklahoma Attorney General Mike Hunter said that office is reviewing the decision and will formally respond within the next few days. Opioids were involved in almost 400,000 overdose deaths from 1999 to 2017, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Following a non-jury trial, Balkman ruled in August that Oklahoma had proven that J&J engaged in misleading marketing about the benefits of painkillers, and that their addictive risks caused a public nuisance in the form of the opioid crisis. Hunter had sought to have J&J pay $17 billion to help fund addiction treatment and other services to repair damage from the opioid epidemic over the next 30 years. Balkman, however, awarded only enough money for one year of programs, saying Oklahoma failed to support its claims regarding the need to abate the epidemic in future years. Following the August ruling, Oklahoma asked Balkman for permission to return to his courtroom annually to prove those costs, but Balkman on Friday maintained his prior ruling. J&J, meanwhile, argued that it deserved a $355 million credit, reflecting pre-trial settlements by the drugmakers Purdue Pharma LP and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.  Balkman concluded on Friday that state law did not allow such credits. Last month, J&J and four other companies proposed a $48 billion settlement framework to resolve all of the opioid cases they face, with J&J paying $4 billion. Lawyers for the local governments have opposed the proposal. If approved, the settlement would let J&J resolve some of the thousands of product liability lawsuits it faces. The company also faces litigation over whether its baby powder causes cancer, a claim it denies.",

        "explanation": "This article does an excellent job of putting a new finding about the benefits of echinacea in context of previous research. Too often an article will report the new findings and only much lower in the story mention that it contradicts earlier work. From the first paragraph the reporter lets us know we’re getting only the latest news about a messy, unresolved area of study. The reporter also does a first-rate job of gathering a range of sources to put the findings in context. This article goes well beyond the minimum researcher-plus-one-outside-source requirement, with great benefit to readers. But the story falls short in the area of helping readers make informed decisions based on the findings. The article doesn’t provide enough information on the magnitude of the benefits, the costs of the treatment, or the alternatives. This may leave a reader informed but not well prepared to make a decision about how these findings apply to their own lives.",

        "main_text": "Since this article is about a treatment whose benefits are disputed, it should tell readers how much it costs. This would let them do a rough cost-vs.-benefit calculation as they consider whether to use echinacea. The reporter says the study showed a 58 percent reduction in cold risk, and some unspecified ability to shorten duration. It would be useful to know how likely an average adult or child is to get a cold each year, and how long it lasts. This would also help people understand the possible payoff of taking echinacea–and compare it to the costs. The article points out that the herb has some side effects, and quotes a physician mentioning the most common one (a rash, especially in children) and the most important contraindication (pregnancy). It also points out that the study did not take potential harms into account, alerting readers to the possiblity of others not mentioned here. The reporter does an excellent job of describing the technique of meta-analysis, the details of this study, and the benefits and limits of this research approach. He also provides context by describing earlier research into the same question. The article does not exaggerate the effects of colds or the value of the treatment. The reporter does an excellent job describing the rigor of the study and getting the author, an interested party, and a disinterested party to provide perspective. The article fails to mention other options for treating and preventing colds. Again, due to the disputed nature of the findings, this is a significant oversight. The reader will want to know: If echinacea doesn’t work, what else can I try? The article fails to say how widely the herb is used and where it’s available. But it’s probably safe to assume that most Americans know how to find it. The article makes very clear that this treatment has been studied many times before, with contradictory results. The reporter did a significant amount of original reporting.",

        "explanation": "Fanelli's video suggests 'Obamacare' will cut off treatment for elderly",
        "fact_checkers": "Amy Sherman",
        "main_text": "\"Dan Fanelli, a retired airline captain and Republican running against U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, who represents the Orlando, Fla., area, has a catchy video on his website related to the health care bill dubbed \"\"Obamacare. \"\"Set in a doctor's office with somber orchestral music as the backdrop, a sympathetic doctor rolls up his chair to talk to an elderly white-haired man in a patient's gown. \"\"I'm sorry. I've tried everything,\"\" the doctor says. \"\"But doctor, I've already waited over six months,'' says the patient. \"\"I can't bear this any longer. \"\"\"\"It's not that it's ...,\"\" the kind doctor hesitates, placing his hand on the patient's shoulder. \"\"They denied you because you passed the age limit for the treatment. \"\"The depressed old man's gaze averts downward -- perhaps a hint that he realizes he will die?Will the new health care bill approved by Congress translate to denying treatment to sweet old men like the one featured in the video? Will somber-faced doctors be telling grandpa that he is too old for treatment? We had to check this out. First we contacted Fanelli, who said he posted the video on his website in late March. We asked if he could point us to any documentation -- such as a section of the bill, a position paper from an organization -- to support his conclusion about age limits. The simple answer: no. \"\"You are asking for substantiation. I can't go to a page in the bill but what I can tell you is the country is over $13 trillion in debt. ... The medical program increases the number of recipients substantially. When you increase the number dramatically ... where is the money going to come from? It is obvious it's going to have to be only certain people are going to get certain coverages. ... The commercial is to show what is going on in other countries with socialized medicine. You can't add more services when you don't have enough money to pay the government bills currently, and that's what we've done. \"\"Fanelli said he has his own family experience to draw his conclusions. \"\"My aunt lives in France and had been denied for a procedure,\"\" to get a pacemaker, he said. \"\"The reason she was denied was because she was too old. Common sense tells me when you increase the number of people covered, and you don't have enough money to go around ... there's eventually going to come to point where we say what can we afford, what we can't afford.\"\" Ultimately his French aunt was able to get the procedure, according to Fanelli.Fanelli said the video \"\"is a metaphor for what is used in England where they use age to determine what services people are going to get. \"\"Our friends at FactCheck.org researched a question about age limits and health care in England in July 2009. The article quoted a nonprofit in England, Age Concern and Help the Aged, that ageism does occur -- for example a doctor refusing to refer an elderly patient to a consultant. But the nonprofit also stated that a national organization was created to improve health care for the elderly and one of its standards was \"\"rooting out age discrimination. \"\"Steve Ullmann, professor and director of Programs in Health Sector Management and Policy at the University of Miami, said \"\"there is some limitation in provisions of care of people based on age in England,\"\" for certain treatments though \"\"you can buy them out of pocket outside of the National Health Service. \"\"Back to health care in the United States. We asked specifically if Fanelli had found an age-limit in the health care bill. \"\"I have tried to look at that bill and it's a masterful mess,'' said the 54-year-old retired airline captain and Navy reserves retiree. When we asked about whether Fanelli had read about an age cutoff in news articles, he replied: \"\"I have been at lectures.\"\" He heard one from a brain surgeon. \"\"I don't remember the name. I wasn't anticipating getting a phone interview on this.\"\" We contacted him again the next day to clarify if he had read any news articles about an age limit and he said: \"\"There are various articles. I can't quote verse, page and date. ... We arrived at the claim because there is not enough money generated in tax revenue to pay for the current expenses for the U.S. government and this is going to be an additional expense. \"\"Among Fanelli's claimed sources is his wife's dermatologist, Dr. John Meisenheimer of Orlando. He said the doctor saved his wife's life when she had skin cancer. Meisenheimer also is the doctor starring in Fanelli's video. \"\"Meisenheimer has discussed they are going to be picking and choosing,\"\" Fanelli said. \"\"It is generally accepted by medical health professionals there will only be limited amount of money. Most people believe it will be younger people as opposed to older people. \"\"We called Meisenheimer, a board-certified dermatologist for more than 20 years, to get his explanation of the video. \"\"The ad is a metaphor for ageism,\"\" Meisenheimer said. \"\"This isn't about 'death panels.' Death panels do not exist. \"\"(PolitiFact agrees with Meisenheimer about death panels. That was a claim made by Sarah Palin in August 2009 that we rated . )But the health care bill makes cuts to Medicare, he said, and that will lead to less care for the elderly. \"\"It can be a very slippery slope. It's not going to happen like in the commercial,'' said Meisenheimer, whose office website states that he accepts Medicare patients. \"\"Doctors will have to make a decision: where is the best use of money? Do I use it for a 95-year-old who has skin cancer or for somebody younger? ... There is not enough money there in the can for everybody.\"\" The Kaiser Family Foundation states that the Medicare provisions are estimated to result in a net reduction of $428 billion between 2010 and 2019. It also states that the bill supports \"\"comparative effectiveness research\"\" to compare the clinical effectiveness of treatments, but that the findings \"\"may not be construed as mandates, guidelines, or recommendations for payment, coverage, or treatment or used to deny coverage.\"\" So that seems to say that even if research shows a certain treatment for the elderly isn't effective, that can't be used to create an age limit for that treatment.We also contacted the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services which oversees Medicare. Spokesman Peter Ashkenaz told us in an e-mail that there are no age limits for treatment under Medicare. \"\"There are no eligibility changes to Medicare in the new law,\"\" he wrote.Fanelli said his video hasn't aired on television, though it's on his campaign website and on YouTube. We sent links to Fanelli's video to experts on the health care bill: Ullmann at the University of Miami; Alwyn Cassil, director of public affairs for the Center for Studying Health System Change, a nonpartisan research organization; and Len Nichols, Director for the Center for Health Policy Research and Ethics at George Mason University. All three said there is nothing in the bill that would cut off treatment based on an age limit.The video \"\"has no basis in reality whatsoever,\"\" Cassil said. \"\"There is nothing in that bill that I am aware of, or certainly every reporter who has combed every inch of it that mentions anything about 'age limits.' '' So to recap, Fanelli's ad offers a dramatic scene that has no solid facts behind it. He claims it portrays \"\"Obamacare,\"\" but he cannot cite any provisions in the health care bill -- other than vague fear of a European system -- that could cause such a tragic scene. He referred us to his wife's dermatologist -- who also happens to be the star of the commercial -- but the dermatologist did not produce any conclusive evidence, either. So the ad has lots of melodrama but no facts. We find the claim .\"",

        "date_published": "February 18, 2019",
        "explanation": "It’s true that Humphrey did say he viewed a woman as a “host” for a fetus once she has become pregnant, but he did not reduce the entire status of women in society to that of a host, even stipulating that beyond the context of pregnancy, “your body is your body.” It is a matter of subjective opinion whether or not one accepts his distinction as being sincere or meaningful, but the fact remains that Humphrey did express such a viewpoint.",
        "fact_checkers": "Dan MacGuill",
        "main_text": "In early 2019, an Oklahoma lawmaker’s two-year-old comments about abortion re-emerged online and prompted skeptical inquiries from our readers. On 15 February, the Gaily Grind web site posted an article with the headline “GOP Lawmaker Who Called Pregnant Women ‘Hosts’ Pushing Bill Requiring Men to Approve All Abortions,” which reported that: Oklahoma state legislator Rep. Justin Humphrey (R) has sponsored a draconian bill that would require a woman to get the written consent of the fetus’s father before obtaining an abortion. The bill, HB 1441, which passed out of a House committee Tuesday, would also require a woman “to provide, in writing, the identity of the father of the fetus to the physician who is to perform or induce the abortion,” according to the bill’s language. “If the person identified as the father of the fetus challenges the fact that he is the father, such individual may demand that a paternity test be performed.” In justifying the bill, Rep. Humphrey told The Intercept that women have no right to their bodies once they become pregnant because they are mere “hosts.” The Gaily Grind’s 2019 article created the impression that it was describing current events, but in reality Humphrey had made his remarks two years earlier, in February 2017, and they had generated a wave of outrage at the time. Humphrey did indeed say that he viewed a woman as a “host” for a fetus, although he stipulated that this view was limited to the context of pregnancy and abortion, stating that his more general view of female bodily autonomy was “your body is your body.” On 6 February 2017, State Representative Justice Humphrey, a Republican who represents the 19th District in southeastern Oklahoma, introduced House Bill 1441, which would have prohibited any abortion that took place without the written informed consent of the fetus’ father, except in cases of rape or incest, or the father was deceased, or the woman’s life was in danger. On 14 February 2017, the State Legislature’s Public Health Committee voted in favor of the bill, but it never came before the general assembly and was never passed into law. In the landmark 1992 case Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania vs. Casey case, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled as unconstitutional a part of a Pennsylvania state law requiring that a married woman provide her husband with advance notification that she intended to undergo an abortion. As a result, any law requiring a woman to obtain the consent of her sexual partner for an abortion would almost certainly have been overturned in court on the basis that it imposed an “undue burden” on a woman’s right of access to abortion, as set out in the 1973 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Roe vs. Wade. In an interview with the Intercept web site, published on 13 February 2017, Humphrey outlined the rationale behind his proposed legislation: At first, Humphrey said that the original intention of the bill was to ensure that fathers are involved in supporting a child from conception. “I was wanting fathers to have to pay child support at the beginning,” he said, but that specific language was excised from the bill. Ultimately, he said, his intent was to let men have a say. “I believe one of the breakdowns in our society is that we have excluded the man out of all of these types of decisions,” he said. “I understand that they feel like that is their body,” he said of women. “I feel like it is a separate — what I call them is, is you’re a ‘host.’ And you know when you enter into a relationship you’re going to be that host and so, you know, if you pre-know that then take all precautions and don’t get pregnant,” he explained. “So that’s where I’m at. I’m like, hey, your body is your body and be responsible with it. But after you’re irresponsible then don’t claim, well, I can just go and do this with another body, when you’re the host and you invited that in.” So Humphrey did indeed say that once a woman has become pregnant, in his view she is a “host” for the fetus, and that her obligation to the fetus stems from that dynamic. However, he did also indicate that outside the context of pregnancy, his view of a woman’s bodily autonomy was “Hey, your body is your body and be responsible with it.” This nuance was not fully acknowledged in some of the initial reporting on Humphrey’s remarks, such as the February 2017 article on the web site of New York magazine’s “The Cut,” whose headline read: “Oklahoma Anti-Abortion Lawmaker Says Women Are Merely ‘Hosts’,” or an opinion column on the web site Bustle, which read: Of all the ridiculous things male politicians have said about abortion policy — looking at you, Todd “Legitimate Rape” Akin — saying that women’s bodies literally aren’t theirs is among the worst I’ve heard. So, too, is the bizarre idea of women as “hosts,” the same word you’d use for an organism being victimized by a parasite. Anti-choice politicians are sometimes criticized for allegedly treating women as mere incubators; Humphrey, in that interview, seems to explicitly endorse that train of thought.",

A: No. The drugs that have killed four people in the last two months are unregulated and illegal. Four people have died after using drugs made to imitate the high of marijuana in Illinois over the last two months. That’s true.It’s not true that the drugs they used were approved by the Food and Drug Administration, as was claimed by a story circulating on Facebook under the headline: “Big Pharma Synthetic Marijuana Leaves 2 Dead, 89 Hospitalized In Illinois.”The number of those who died is wrong in the headline because the story was copied, for the most part, from a legitimate report that was published on April 6, when that number was accurate.The recent story that Facebook users flagged as potentially false comes from a site registered to an owner in Pakistan and differs in a couple of important ways from the original. It has a misleading headline (indicating that the drugs were made by regulated pharmaceutical manufacturers) and it starts out with a sentence that is wrong.It says at the top: “The users ingested an FDA-approved version of synthetic cannabis known as K2 or Spice.”That’s not true.The FDA has approved three drugs with synthetic versions of chemicals similar to or the same as those found in marijuana — Marinol, Syndros, and Cesamet can be used to help with nausea from cancer treatments and Marinol and and Syndros can also be used to treat weight loss in AIDS patients. The FDA is currently reviewing another drug related to marijuana that would treat epilepsy.Neither “K2” nor “Spice” has been approved by the FDA, administration spokesman Michael Felberbaum confirmed.Not only are they not approved by the FDA, those are two of the most common names under which imitation marijuana is sold. A Drug Enforcement Administration official, Susan Gibson, used them as an example when she testified in front of Congress earlier this year, saying, “Synthetic cannabinoids and their byproducts (sometimes sold under brand names such as K2 or Spice) continue to be a significant threat to public health and safety.”Synthetic cannabinoids are typically sprayed onto dried plant material and smoked or used in e-cigarettes to achieve a high similar to marijuana, but their effects can be unpredictable and dangerous, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. The drugs used in the recent spate of overdoses in Illinois and surrounding states included a chemical found in rat poison, according to the Illinois Department of Public Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.NIDA: These chemicals are called cannabinoids because they are similar to chemicals found in the marijuana plant. Because of this similarity, synthetic cannabinoids are sometimes misleadingly called “synthetic marijuana” (or “fake weed”), and they are often marketed as safe, legal alternatives to that drug. In fact, they are not safe and may affect the brain much more powerfully than marijuana; their actual effects can be unpredictable and, in some cases, more dangerous or even life-threatening.The chemical composition of imitation marijuana can vary, which makes legislating against it difficult, although all 50 states have banned some form of synthetic cannabinoids, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. In Illinois, imitation marijuana is illegal under two laws — one that was passed specifically to address those drugs and under the state’s Controlled Substances Act, according to Eileen Boyce, spokeswoman for the Illinois attorney general.In April 2017 the DEA temporarily added chemical compounds often used in imitation marijuana to the list of schedule 1 controlled substances, citing overdoses on the increasingly popular drug as the reason. Those compounds are set to remain on the list until April 10, 2019.So, if you’ve read the story traveling around Facebook and gotten the impression that people are dying from legal, regulated medications related to marijuana — they’re not. The imitation marijuana that is killing people is unregulated and illegal.Editor’s note: FactCheck.org is one of several organizations working with Facebook to debunk false stories flagged by readers on the social media network.Illinois Department of Public Health.

We got really close, shared some of our deepest secrets, the words I love you came naturally, and basically I had never felt so strongly for someone so quickly.\n\nProblem is, she goes to school 11 driving hours away. Her parents house and my parents house are right by each other, but unfortunately we go to school miles and miles apart. It is our senior year, and at first we didn't think it would make sense to be serious about this relationship when we started school (which is now), and just hope that we would meet up again after the school year. But, obviously, the more time we spent together, the closer we got, the more attached we got, and now we find ourselves in a long distance relationship. \n\nI've done this once before, with only a 2 hour separation and it didn't work out for other reasons, so my view on LDR's isn't completely shot. But i didn't want to get into another one because I loved the freedom college provided and it is my senior year. However, this girl came along, and completely changed my mind. I am convinced that if we get through this LDR, I will marry her. She is everything I want and more.\n\nI came here to seek advice from you wonderful redditors, hopefully who have experienced similar circumstances. If it was the beginning of my sophomore year things would be different, because I dont think I could do ~3 years of LDR. But 1 year doesn't seem so bad.

Need advice.\n\nText: At the end of May, I met a wonderful girl. We hit it off instantly and feelings were mutual; no games involved. We got really close, shared some of our deepest secrets, the words I love you came naturally, and basically I had never felt so strongly for someone so quickly.\n\nProblem is, she goes to school 11 driving hours away. Her parents house and my parents house are right by each other, but unfortunately we go to school miles and miles apart. It is our senior year, and at first we didn't think it would make sense to be serious about this relationship when we started school (which is now), and just hope that we would meet up again after the school year. But, obviously, the more time we spent together, the closer we got, the more attached we got, and now we find ourselves in a long distance relationship. \n\nI've done this once before, with only a 2 hour separation and it didn't work out for other reasons, so my view on LDR's isn't completely shot. But i didn't want to get into another one because I loved the freedom college provided and it is my senior year. However, this girl came along, and completely changed my mind. I am convinced that if we get through this LDR, I will marry her. She is everything I want and more.\n\nI came here to seek advice from you wonderful redditors, hopefully who have experienced similar circumstances. If it was the beginning of my sophomore year things would be different, because I dont think I could do ~3 years of LDR. But 1 year doesn't seem so bad. I know it will suck at times, and communication is key, but what are some tips, tricks, advice, words of encouragement that would help me get through this with her?\n\nTL;DR:",

        "main_text": "A more accurate description: Two starters bouncing back from testicular cancer. “Both healthy. Both in the big leagues,” the Pirates’ Taillon said. “Life’s good.” The Rockies’ Bettis underwent surgery in November 2016 for testicular cancer and continued cancer treatments through that spring and into last season. So when Taillon had surgery to treat testicular cancer on May 8, 2017, he had an instant line of support. “Baseball is a brotherhood. When something happens to our own, everyone comes together — even more so when there are two people going through the same thing,” the 26-year-old Taillon said. “It made sense to reach out to each other and give our well-wishes and see if there’s anything we could offer up to each other. “I just felt like if I needed anything or had a question, I was very comfortable going to ask him about any part of the process.” Taillon did, too. Simple things: How often did you get your blood levels checked? What was the treatment like? “It was really nothing crazy, but that was comforting,” Taillon said. “He was months ahead of me and what I was going through. It was nice to have somebody I could ask questions.” Taillon’s eyes lit up when he heard that Bettis would come off the disabled list — Bettis has been dealing with a blister — to make the start. Bettis hadn’t been officially named the starter when the clubhouse was open Monday, but he did say how “cool” it would to face Taillon. “It will be really nice for that to happen,” said Bettis, who returned to the Rockies’ starting rotation on Aug. 14, 2017, after his recovery. Bettis hasn’t pitched for the Rockies since July 1 due to a blister on his middle finger. He’s tried every remedy, but it keeps bothering him. So the 29-year-old texted Taillon, who’s been dealing with a cut on his middle finger as well. “He had some good insight,” Bettis said. “There were a couple things he was doing, that I felt we could try and see how it worked out. It was good to get some feedback.” Taillon’s advice? Use a finger sleeve and take days off. He also told Bettis how precisely he was clipping his fingernails. “But you can see I don’t have too much great advice,” Taillon laughed, showing off his cracked finger. “I’m still working through it. I’m still battling my own thing.” It took Taillon about a month to return to the mound last season after testicular cancer surgery. In his first start back on June 12, 2017, he threw five scoreless innings as the Pirates beat the Rockies. Later that season, Taillon got a hit off Chicago Cubs starter Jon Lester, a cancer survivor, and was chatting with first baseman Anthony Rizzo, who was diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma as a teenager. “Rizzo looked at me and said, ‘Hey, there are three cancer survivors right here — me, you and Lester,’” Taillon recounted. “That moment was cool for me. “Facing off against Chad will be one of those cool moments.” ___ More AP baseball: https://apnews.com/tag/MLBbaseball",

        "main_text": "\"Nearly 50 years later, Tommy Chong promoted his drug of choice by invoking one of Nixon’s political rivals and predecessor as president, John F. Kennedy. Chong, an actor and part of the former Cheech and Chong comedy team, made his plug for pot with a Jan. 30 post on Instagram that has more than 70,000 likes. The post features a black-and-white image of Kennedy in a shirt and tie. Kennedy appears to be exhaling smoke while holding perhaps a cigar of some sort. Text below the image claims: \"\"JFK SMOKED CANNABIS IN THE WHITE HOUSE, WHILE PRESIDENT, BECAUSE HE SUFFERED FROM SEVERE BACK PAIN & ADDISON'S DISEASE.\"\" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Kennedy suffered from a number of serious ailments, including chronic back pain and Addison’s disease (which causes extreme fatigue and other symptoms). He was known for trying to keep them secret. He served less than three years as president before being assassinated in Dallas in 1963. There’s no proof he smoked marijuana to treat his ailments. We asked historians and consulted the history books. A 1998 book on Mary Meyer, one of Kennedy’s mistresses, recounted a 1976 National Enquirer story that said Meyer and Kennedy smoked marijuana once at the White House. The information in the article was attributed to the late Jim Pruitt, who by then was a former Washington Post editor, who said Meyer told him about the encounter. The Washington Post reported on the Enquirer article at the time. According to the Post, Pruitt confirmed his account about the marijuana smoking, said he had given the marijuana to Meyer, and he said the Enquirer had paid him for the story. But none of that goes to the idea that Kennedy regularly used marijuana at the White House in order to fight his ailments. Stacey Flores Chandler, a reference archivist at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library, told us the foundation has Kennedy’s medical records from the 1950s and ‘60s as well as records of several of Kennedy's physicians. \"\"I haven't found any evidence in either the records here or in secondary sources that the president used cannabis as a treatment for any of his medical conditions,\"\" she told us. Chandler also noted that historian Robert Dallek, who had access to Kennedy’s medical records, wrote about amphetamines, steroids, painkillers and other medications prescribed for Kennedy’s back and Addison’s, but made no mention of marijuana. We messaged Chong’s website but didn’t get a reply. A social media post claims Kennedy \"\"smoked cannabis in the White House, while president, because he suffered from severe back pain and Addison's disease.\"\" There is an unconfirmed, secondhand account that Kennedy once smoked marijuana at the White House. And he did suffer back pain and Addison’s, according to records. But there is no evidence to support the suggestion that Kennedy regularly smoked marijuana in the White House because of his physical ailments.\"",

        "explanation": "\"This was an interesting update on the importance of vitamin D in human health, highlighting a recent meta-analysis on the topic. The reporter did a particularly nice job of including expert comments in the piece. It would have been stronger with a brief comment on potential harms of excess vitamin D intake, and with the presentation of absolute (not just relative) benefit data where possible. The story also let some researchers get away with some enthusiastic quotes that seemed to cry out for balance:   \"\"You should probably get rid of all the other vitamins in the medicine cabinet.\"\" \"\"I’ve been trying to give bottles of vitamin D to my family for holidays for years.\"\" And ending on this quote: \"\"It’s such a simple thing. Imagine taking a vitamin to prevent cancer. It’s almost too good to be true.\"\" Perhaps the better summary would be a line that appears far earlier in the story:  \"\"Past experience means there is some need to be cautious about vitamins.\"\" Nonetheless, overall this was a good job of reporting.\"",
        "fact_checkers": " ",
        "main_text": "\"There was no estimate of the costs associated with obtaining the amounts of vitamin D mentioned in the story. The story did an adequate job quantifying the benefits found in the meta-analysis:  \"\"Over an average of nearly six years, those who took vitamin D had a 7 percent lower risk of death from all causes than those who did not. Some scientists say more years of study would give better clues as to how large a role vitamin D plays in decreasing mortality. Others point out that while there was a statistically significant 7 percent drop in mortality in Autier’s analysis, because of the size of the study that only accounted for a difference of 117 people who died in the control groups as compared with those who took vitamin D supplements.\"\" The story made it appear as though any form of vitamin D were safe to consume in whatever dosage a reader might envisage and this is misleading. It mentioned \"\"there is little evidence of vitamin D toxicity at levels under 10,000 IU a day\"\", and while rare, there are cases of lethal doses of vitamin D that have been documented. The story could have explained that there are definite harms of excess vitamin D. The story did an adequate job explaining the 18-study meta-analysis. The story did not engage in overt disease mongering. The story included comments from several researchers involved with investigating the benefits of vitamin D who were not connected to the authors of the highlighted study. The story covered the various means for obtaining sufficient levels of vitamin D (food, sunshine, functional foods, and supplements). It could have explained that the application of high SPF value creams and lotions blocks the body’s ability to convert sunlight into circulating vitamin D. The story mentioned that commercially available vitamin D supplements were available, listed some food sources rich in vitamin D, as well as other foods which are fortified with the vitamin. The story was clear that it was reporting on the results of a recently published meta-analysis of previously published data. Does not appear to rely on a press release.\"",

        "main_text": "A man does chin-ups at a city park in Kiev, March 19, 2012. REUTERS/Anatolii Stepanov Experts say often a professional tweak can go a long way towards firming up your workout. “People usually injure themselves on basic exercises, like a squat or a bench press,” said New York-based personal trainer Tiffany Boucher. But Boucher, who works for the national chain of fitness centers Equinox, said form is relatively easy to fix. “Something is being overused, usually in tandem with some type of muscle imbalance,” she said. “So it’s often about getting people to put their shoulders in a certain place, find their center of gravity, engage their abdominals, or tilt their pelvis in a certain direction.”   She said even a small adjustment can be transformative. Knees are the most common focus of client complaint, according to Boucher. Once form is corrected, relief often comes within weeks. “People don’t have that continued inflammation,” she said. Dr. Daniel Solomon, a spokesperson for the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, believes in getting the help of a professional trainer before embarking on a new routine. “Most of what we see are strains and really preventable muscle-type injuries,” said Solomon, a California-based physician specializing in sports medicine. “People just do things their bodies aren’t ready to do or capable of sustaining for long.”   Another big mistake is skipping the warm up. “They jump right in instead of spending 15 minutes to do a good cardio warm up and stretching before grabbing the weight,” he said. He said some workouts just require more expertise than others. “I’m a proponent of using free weights,” he said. “But you’ve got to make sure you have the technique correct.”   Jessica Matthews, an exercise physiologist for the American Council on Exercise, said many highly effective workouts, such as kettle bells, medicine balls, and plyometric (jumping) moves, can be dangerous if done incorrectly. “Some workouts are trickier,” said Matthews, who is based in San Diego, California. “I’ve seen a lot of people use free weights incorrectly. There is a much greater margin of error than with machines, which move on a fixed path.”   Before going all-out on the plyometric training that characterizes so many home DVD workouts, she said it’s important to learn to land safely, which means softly and on the mid-foot. “The body is one big kinetic chain. Dysfunction in one area will create dysfunction in another,” she said. “So suddenly your hip is bothering you because of instability in your ankle.”   Before tackling the latest high-intensity, technique-based workout, Matthews advises strengthening your stability and mobility through back-to-basic exercises such as plank, side plank, lunges and squats. “Build that solid foundation first,” she said. “Then progress to more explosive workouts that take more advanced skills.”   If don’t have your own personal trainer, Boucher said, don’t hesitate to ask a fitness professional at your gym to observe your form for a few seconds. Then be open to the feedback. “Do you hunch your shoulders? Hunch your back? “ she said. “Maybe one side of your body is tighter than the other. Or the left hip is more rotated than the right.”   “Sometimes it’s that little thing that you can’t catch on your own,” she said.",

        "paragraph": "(1)О несправедливости говорят и пишут с древних времён — возможно, с тех пор, как человечество вообще научилось говорить и писать. (2)Что же такое несправедливость — всё ещё не ясно. (3)Очень непросто прийти к согласию в этом вопросе, поскольку в данном случае спор ведётся с достаточной долей заинтересованности. (4)Каждый хочет, чтобы с ним обошлись «справедливо», и жалуется на «несправедливость», однако пытается так истолковать ситуацию, чтобы сразу же стала очевидной несправедливость по отношению к нему. (5)И каждый обладает достаточным самомнением, чтобы судить «справедливо» об отношении к другим людям, и совсем не замечает, что другие возмущаются его мнимой «справедливостью». (6)Так проблема искажается страстями и окутывается предрассудками. (7)Целые поколения застревают в этих предрассудках, и замечаешь порой, как само слово «справедливость» вызывает язвительную улыбку. (8)От предыдущих поколений человечеству досталось по наследству убеждение, будто люди от рождения равны и вследствие этого с ними надо обходиться одинаково. (9)Однако сущность справедливости состоит как раз в неодинаковом обхождении с неодинаковыми людьми. (10)Если бы люди были действительно равны, жизнь была бы предельно простой и справедливость было бы чрезвычайно легко найти. (11)Стоило бы только сказать: одинаковым людям — одинаковую долю или всем всего поровну. (12)Тогда справедливость можно было бы обосновывать арифметически и создавать механически; и все были бы довольны, потому что люди стали бы не чем иным, как одинаковыми атомами, своего рода всюду катящимися механическими шариками, которые были бы похожи внешне и имели бы внутренне одинаковый душевный склад. (13)Как наивно, как просто, как мелко!(14)На самом же деле люди не равны ни телом, ни душою, ни духом. (15)Они родятся существами различного пола, с различным здоровьем и силой, с совершенно различными предрасположенностями, дарами, инстинктами и желаниями, они принадлежат к различному духовному уровню, и с ними (в силу справедливости!)(16)В этом заключается основа и главная трудность справедливости: людей — бесконечное множество; все они различны; как сделать, чтобы каждый получил согласно справедливости?(17)Если люди неодинаковы, значит, и обходиться с ними надо каждый раз согласно их живому своеобразию — иначе возникает несправедливость. (18)Таким образом, справедливость означает именно неравенство: беречь ребёнка, помогать слабому, снисходить к уставшему, ухаживать за больным; проявлять больше строгости к безвольному, больше доверия честному, больше осторожности к болтуну; герою оказывать почести. (19)Справедливость поэтому — искусство неравенства, и она присуща лишь благородным душам. (20) У неё обострённое чувство реальности; проистекающая от доброго сердца и живой наблюдательности, она отвергает механический подход к людям, старается уловить в человеке его сущность и своеобразие и обходиться с ним соответственно этому.

        "explanation": "The story outlines how new research about an existing family of consumer blood tests shows accuracy at seven weeks into pregnancy for determining the sex of a fetus. What the story also tells is the complicated weighing of risks and benefits that parents may need to use, since the consumer tests and their laboratories are not regulated by the FDA. We would have liked more information in here about which precise forms of testing among the 57 studies analyzed were most reliable and the quality of the evidence in the Journal of the American Medical Association survey. Earlier sex-determination in pregnancy could lead to parents choosing (or trying to choose) the gender they prefer. Internationally, it is already clear that some parents in China and India are deliberately choosing male babies, and aborting female fetuses. The research reported on, a survey in the Journal of the American Medical Association, does not directly address these larger ethical implications. But the study’s lead author, Diana Bianchi, does stress that she wants to examine “why people are buying these things” and the consequences of consumer access to over-the-counter testing for fetal gender. The New York Times story goes a bit further than the competing Reuters story in exploring how consumers may use the testing.",
        "fact_checkers": " ",
        "main_text": "The story quotes one price estimate of about $250 for the testing. We would have liked more detail about whether new details on accuracy of the tests might change their status in the marketplace, or whether insurability status might change. Parents who fear their child may inherit gender-linked disorders, such as hemophilia, could use this test earlier in pregnancy and possibly avoid more invasive procedures, such as amniocentesis. Amniocentesis carries a risk of miscarriage. We would have liked some numbers about how many women in the US are facing this dilemma; the situations that carry benefit are few. The average gestational “age” at enrollment in prenatal care in the US is after the window in which most of these tests are marketed. So that means if a couple did not know that they needed to think about X-linked mental retardation “fragile X” (which affect males) or hemophilia, the use of the test would not really be integrated into their care. Could have been more skeptical of why they are really being marketed – closer to entertainment ultrasounds than medical care. Yes, the story lists potential harms. These range from inaccuracy, because the tests are unregulated and the laboratories don’t have to meet medical standards, to the potential for abortions based on fetal gender. This story does not evaluate the quality of the evidence in the new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, which prompted the headlines. We applaud some of the details, giving consumers information about the lawsuit about one consumer product, but the discussion leaves readers confused about how to evaluate reliability. We’re surprised that the story didn’t point out in absolute terms that 5 of every 100 tests of girls and 1 of every 100 boys will be wrong – 6 out of a hundred multiplied by millions of pregnancies a year! That’s a lot of errors even if uptake is minimal. This story balances the potential for danger in giving parents early information about the sex of a fetus and the genuine benefit for some in avoiding more invasive testing when a condition is ruled out by knowing the gender information. The story quoted four sources, in addition to the study’s lead author. The story explains how parents who fear a sex-linked genetic problem for their fetus must balance risk against benefit in existing alternatives.It did not do a very detailed job of comparing how the new approach could compare, especially considering there is a risk of inaccurate results in the new approach. The hypothetical target group for these tests is much, much smaller than the broader use is and might become. It did do a better job than the Reuters story in describing other tests (urine tests) that have been developed. Yes, the story explains there are a variety of tests that have been widely available to consumers. But the story could have done a better job of connecting the dots for readers. Exactly how does one get a blood test done for a home test kit? Raises questions like: do I go to a lab? Finger stick? Are their costs other than the test? Shipping? Do I do this at home myself? Working with my medical care team? How soon do I get the results?, etc. Process of using several common kits could have been better described. The new research was on testing that is not novel, but by surveying 57 other studies, they reached a new conclusion about overall accuracy and how early in pregnancy it could predict gender.

The story could have done more to point out that many researchers are now questioning the HDL/heart disease hypothesis. But the story does a good job of presenting the harms of the failed drug in terms of natural frequencies (actual numbers) instead of relative rates.

        "date_published": "",
        "explanation": "Facing growing criticism, the Department of Veterans Affairs said Friday that it will not halt use of an unproven malaria drug on veterans with  COVID-19 but that fewer of its patients are now taking it.",
        "fact_checkers": " Hope Yen",
        "main_text": "In responses provided to Congress and obtained by The Associated Press, the VA said it never “encouraged or discouraged” its government-run hospitals to use hydroxychloroquine on patients even as President Donald Trump heavily promoted the drug for months without scientific evidence of its effectiveness. Still, it acknowledged that VA Secretary Robert Wilkie had wrongly asserted publicly without evidence that the drug had been shown to benefit younger veterans. The VA, the nation’s largest hospital system, also agreed more study was needed on the drug and suggested its use was now limited to extenuating circumstances, such as last-ditch efforts to save a coronavirus patient’s life. In the first week of May, 17 patients had received the drug for COVID-19, according to VA data obtained by the AP. The department declined to say how many patients had been treated with hydroxychloroquine for the coronavirus since January, but a recent analysis of VA hospital data showed that hundreds of veterans had taken it by early April. “VA has not endorsed nor discouraged the use of hydroxychloroquine in COVID-19 patients and has left those decisions to providers and their patients,” the VA said. “While all drugs have the potential for adverse events and some drugs in particular, like hydroxychloroquine, are known to have specific risks, when they are used carefully and judiciously, they can be managed safely.” As of Friday, 11,883 veterans had been confirmed to be infected with the virus and 985 had died, according to VA statistics. Responding to written questions from Sen. Jon Tester, the top Democrat on the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, the department admitted it had no studies or evidence to back up Wilkie’s claim that hydroxychloroquine had shown effectiveness in younger veterans in particular. “The use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID has dropped off dramatically,” the VA said. Trump repeatedly has pushed the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine with or without the antibiotic azithromycin, but no large, rigorous studies have found them safe or effective for COVID-19, and they can cause heart rhythm problems and other side effects. The Food and Drug Administration has warned against the drug combination and said hydroxychloroquine should only be used for the coronavirus in formal studies. Two large observational studies, each involving around 1,400 patients in New York, recently found no benefit from hydroxychloroquine. Two new ones published Thursday in the journal BMJ, one by French researchers and the other from China, reached the same conclusion. Tester, who received VA’s responses this week, said he remained concerned about the drug’s safety. “Any drug used to treat patients with COVID-19, especially veterans living with debilitating preexisting conditions, must be proven safe and effective before it’s administered,” he said. “Given recent studies from both VA and other hospitals, hydroxychloroquine seems to fall short of those requirements.” Major veterans organizations and Democrats including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer had called on the VA to explain why it allowed the use of an unproven drug on vets. Last week, a whistleblower complaint by former Health and Human Services official Rick Bright alleged that the Trump administration wanted to “flood” hot spots in New York and New Jersey with the drug. Jeremy Butler, CEO of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, said Friday that his group was heartened by the VA’s preliminary explanations and called it imperative that it release additional details. “It remains concerning that it took this long to begin to get answers to basic questions,” he said. The analysis of VA hospital data, done by independent researchers at two universities with VA approval, was not a rigorous experiment. Researchers analyzed medical records of 368 older male veterans hospitalized with confirmed coronavirus infection at VA medical centers who died or were discharged by April 11. About 28% of veterans who were given hydroxychloroquine plus usual care died, versus 11% of those getting routine care alone. In its response to Congress, the department provided copies of some of its guidance issued to VA physicians on hydroxychloroquine from March to May. It made clear that hydroxychloroquine should be considered mostly for use in clinical trials or when medically appropriate after a full discussion with the patient about risks. The VA did not explain the circumstances in which veterans in the recent analysis of hospital data were given the drug, only suggesting that “it is possible” they were prescribed as part of last efforts to save a patient’s life. “Based on the principles of patient-centric care, it would be inappropriate to deny patients access to hydroxychloroquine under these dire circumstances,” VA wrote. It said it had followed the approach of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases by “summarizing the medical literature regarding unapproved treatments for COVID-19 and making that available to VA clinicians in their shared decision-making with patients.” That guidance now includes preliminary studies on remdesivir, which has been federally approved for emergency use to treat COVID-19. One VA document dated March 25 notes a few “very small cohort studies” showing possible “beneficial effects” but adds “these data have NOT been verified in randomized controlled trials and are extremely preliminary.” The VA acknowledged to Congress that it had placed bulk orders for hydroxychloroquine from Feb. 1 to April 23 for 6.3 million tablets worth $208,000 in anticipation of a possible shortage of the drug, but that most of it was being used for approved uses, such as treating lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. It said it did not have breakdowns. The department also said it planned further studies and clinical trials on hydroxychloroquine, including whether it could help prevent infection in veterans who were potentially exposed to COVID-19. It is in discussions with Novartis to have some VA facilities participate in a national clinical trial that will look at the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin in patients with moderate and severe disease. ___ AP Chief Medical Writer Marilynn Marchione in Milwaukee contributed to this report.",

        "main_text": "\"During a recent visit to Virginia, U.S. Sen. Rand Paul took exception to claims that budget cuts have hurt the National Institute of Health’s efforts to find a cure for Ebola. The Kentucky Republican was the headliner at an Oct. 15 rally in Ashland for Dave Brat, the GOP nominee for the 7th District congressional seat. Paul, a Tea Party favorite, said NIH has money to waste. \"\"Do you know what the NIH spends money on?\"\" he asked the crowd. Paul listed a series of NIH projects he viewed as profligate. \"\"$2.4 million of the NIH dollars was spent on ‘origami’ condoms,\"\"  he said. \"\"This is a family crowd, so I’m not getting into what that means.\"\" But we will. We wondered if his claim is correct. Origami is the Japanese art of folding paper to form animals, flowers and other designs, according to Webster’s New World College Dictionary. We struggled to imagine how this centuries-old craft might improve the condom. Paul’s office backed the senator’s statement by sending us several articles about NIH’s funding of condom research, the earliest one published by the Washington Free Beacon this March. Turns out, there’s a California company, named ORIGAMI, that’s vowing to reinvent the condom, a contraceptive that many men don’t like. The company believes the popularity of condoms  -- which must be unrolled and are typically made of latex -- would greatly improve if they were more pleasing, less cumbersome and safer to use. ORIGAMI is developing condom with accordion-like pleats. They’re made of silicone and, because they’re loose-fitting and don’t have to be unrolled, can be put on faster than traditional condoms. The company is seeking FDA approval and hopes sell its product next year. A number of global health organizations are encouraging condom research and development, convinced that greater use of devices will lead to fewer unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases such as AIDs. Since 2006, NIH has awarded seven grants totaling almost $2.5 million to help develop male and female ORIGAMI condoms. The money was provided to Strata Various, a product design firm headed by Danny Resnic, ORIGAMI’s founder. Resnic is listed on the grant documents as the project leader of the research. ORIGAMI’s work has been praised by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which last year handed out $1.1 million in grants other entrepreneurs seeking to improve condoms. The Foundation said ORIGAMI \"\"provides an excellent example of a private enterprise focused on new condom design to promote consistent use by emphasizing the sexual experience.\"\" Now, let’s return to Paul’s speech. The senator, in lamenting the use of public funds to develop  \"\"origami’ condoms,\"\" never defined the difference between the folded paper art and the name of a company. We asked Brian Darling, a spokesman for Paul, whether his boss was referring to Origami with a capital \"\"O,\"\" meaning the company, or a small \"\"o,\"\" meaning the art form. \"\"The senator’s words speak for themselves,\"\" Darling replied in an email. \"\"I don’t understand the confusion.\"\" The day before he appeared in Ashland, Paul spelled origami with a small \"\"o\"\" in Facebook post and a tweet assailing NIH’s spending. \"\"NIH blames tightening federal budget for its inability to produce #Ebolavaccine, but somehow found $2.4 million to develop 'origami' condoms designed with Japanese folding paper in mind,\"\" Paul wrote on his Facebook page. He tweeted, \"\"@NIH cant afford #Ebola vaccine bc of 'budget cuts' but can spend $2.4 mill to develop 'origami' condoms #Priorities http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-\"\" So what does the company have to say about all this? Mark Bardwell, an ORIGAMI spokesman, defended the grants, saying they are given out \"\"based on scientific merit.\"\" \"\"Condoms are considered a medical device. As such, it must pass FDA safety testing standards through clinical trials that are very expensive,\"\" Bardwell said. \"\"An innovation condom could take 3-4 years and several million dollars for R&D and human testing.\"\" Our ruling In trying to document waste at NIH, Paul said the health agency spent $2.4 million on \"\"origami\"\" condoms. Paul didn’t provide any more information in his speech, leaving the crowd to wonder whether tax dollars are going to the development of paper condoms folded into fancy shapes.

I had a couple hours to kill before a family get-together so I decided to knock one more thing off my to-do list and change the oil in my 4Runner.  And so I did.  Or so I thought.  I guess I wasn't paying attention to which drain plug I removed because it turns out I drained the transmission fluid and I added 5.5 qts of oil to what turned out to be an already full oil reservoir.  *Then* I drove 3 miles to my parents' house for the shindig.  \n\nThe only good news in all of this was that my drive to my parents' house was via neighborhood streets so speeds never exceeded 35mph.  About halfway home from the get-together my dash lit up like a Christmas tree and that's when I realized I done goofed.\n\nSo I'm wondering how to proceed (clearly I need to drain the oil since it's way overfilled at this point).  Since I actually drove a few miles with in this condition, when I re-fill the transmission, should I change the filter (which involves removing part of the exhaust, removing the pan, replacing the pan gasket, etc) or should I be okay having only driven only 6 miles at 25-35mph?",

        "explanation": "Lest anyone think we’re unfair to blogs or that we don’t appreciate the brevity embraced by many blogs, please note that this 1-star story ran 474 words. Earlier today we posted a 5-star score for a story that ran only 262 words. It is the quality – not the quantity – of the words that matters.",

        "main_text": "\"Not applicable. Costs of blueberries – or of the \"\"daily dietary supplementation of bioactives in freeze-dried whole blueberry powder\"\" – were not given. But we don’t think this is a major issue. No quantification of benefit in the first study described – only that \"\"participants’  insulin sensitivity increased.\"\" How much did it increase? What clinical significance did that or might it have? This is what readers need to know – not just some surrogate marker. Regarding the second study, the story said \"\"researchers saw a seven- to eight-point drop in the systolic blood pressure of patients who had been drinking the blueberry beverage.\"\" Everyone got a 7-8 point drop? Or was this the average decline? And a decline from what starting point? None of this was explained. That’s inadequate. Not applicable. No harms were mentioned, but we’re not sure there were any worth mentioning in these small, short-term studies. But we can’t give a satisfactory score for what wasn’t reported. Inadequate. First, the story never explained that the first study used not blueberries but \"\"daily dietary supplementation of bioactives in freeze-dried whole blueberry power.\"\" More than a matter of semantics, this raises questions about the whole premise of the article about \"\"eating blueberries.\"\" These study subjects did not eat blueberries. That should have been explained. Second, the story never mentioned what the researchers themselves wrote, that this study was not conclusive and that studies of longer duration were needed. Third, the story never explained that the first study involved only 32 people – only 15 whom got the blueberry bioactive concoction. Finally, the story never addressed the inherent limitations in drawing any conclusions from such a small sample. The second study mentioned in the story – the one about blueberries in people with \"\"pre-hypertension\"\" – never mentioned the significant concerns that have been raised in some corners about disease-mongering of \"\"pre-hypertension.\"\" Note, for example, the recent article in the BMJ by journalist Ray Moynihan, \"\"Who benefits from treating prehypertension.\"\" The story could have at least nodded in the direction of controversy about this diagnosis, rather than touting it as one more disease to be prevented by blueberry consumption. No independent sources were quoted – only the lead researchers. In addition, the first study was funded partially by the United States Highbush Blueberry Council, something the story should have explained. There wasn’t even a line about other methods of lowering risk in those at increased risk of developing diabetes or high blood pressure. It wouldn’t have taken but a few words to satisfy this criterion. The story stated the newer study was of \"\"daily consumption of blueberries.\"\" That’s inaccurate and it’s pertinent to this availability criterion. It was a study of \"\"daily dietary supplementation of bioactives in freeze-dried whole blueberry powder.\"\" How available is this stuff outside a research setting? What difference might that make over consumption of blueberries? More than splitting hairs, this is an important clarification, and one this story didn’t provide. The story at least tried to put two newer studies into the context of \"\"the body of research supporting the benefits of eating blueberries.\"\" But we also think this phrase is too simplistic and potentially misleading. Nonethless we’ll give it the benefit of the doubt. Not applicable. We can’t be sure of the extent to which this blog post may have relied on a news release. We know we saw some of the exact same quotes in other places, suggesting they didn’t come from interviewing the sources.\"",
