Hypothesis: Either 'Brian is a frog' or 'Greg is a lion' but not both.

Let's analyze the validity of the hypothesis:
From the given premises, we can deduce that if Antoine is hungry and Fred dropped the apple, then Greg is a lion. However, the premises do not provide any information about the relationship between Brian being a frog and Greg being a lion. 
The premises do not allow us to logically deduce that either 'Brian is a frog' or 'Greg is a lion' but not both. The hypothesis cannot be deduced from the given premises.

Therefore, the answer is invalid."
