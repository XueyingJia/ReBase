After everyone had their shoes and their balls, we went to our assigned lane.  Once there, we had to set up the computer that keeps track of the scores by putting in our names.  When that was done, my friend Darren went first. He got a strike!  After Darren, Lori, Ann, and Jeff went.  I went last and got a gutter ball.  I got to go again and I knocked over five pins.

I reached into my pocket and felt around - fortunately I had some spare change. I stood up from my desk with a smile on my face and started to make my way down the hall. It was the perfect time for an afternoon snack. What would I want? There were so many options. I could opt for something healthy, maybe a granola or a kind bar. Or maybe, perhaps, it was the perfect time to indulge in some chocolate. On the other hand, I could always play it safe and get some popcorn or even some potato chips. I arrived at the vending machine and glanced at my options. Fully stocked! What luck! My eyes scanned each row and column carefully, paying full attention to the grumbles of my stomach. Finally, I came to E6 - the double twix bar. I felt my hunger pang immediately. Ladies and gentleman, we have a winner. I dug into my pocked and pulled out four quarters, and hastily jammed them into the machine. The twix fell down and not wasting any time I grabbed for it, ready to take a bite and get on with my day.",

I measured 2 tablespoons of coffee into the filter.  I removed the filter holder from my coffee machine and put the clean filter with the french vanilla coffee into it, relishing the aroma.  I clicked the holder into place.  Then I took the glass carafe from the machine and filled it with cold water.  I poured the water into the area above the filter and turned the machine on.  I could hear the water heating and within a few minutes hot water was running down over the coffee grounds and then dripping into the carafe.  When all the water had run over the beans, I poured some into my favorite mug and added a little bit of cream and some sugar.  I left the rest for my family to enjoy when they got up.",

How, why and what Happened?\n\nText: Happened to me tonight - during the  last bit of my shift, an Israeli girl (a regular) stumbles up with her BF and I tell her politely 'hi, there, you've had a bit too much to drink tonight, come back another night'. She immediately gets hostile and starts into me about how she hasn't had anything to drink. I tell her 'hey, it's just policy, if I deem you're not in full control of your faculties, you're not getting served and therefore, you're not coming in. Come back another night'. \nThis is when she loses her shit, flipping out and telling me to go fuck myself, that she's coming in to the club and that I'm a lowly loser piece of shit. As per my judgement, I keep my cool and tell her 'Okay, I was being nice but now you're being belligerent. There is no way you're coming in'.\nThen out of nowhere she starts ripping on my appearance and then ends it with 'oh, it's because I'm black isn't it? You racist fuck, it's because I'm black, so what?! Fuck you!'\nMeanwhile, her bf is just milling about so I turn to him and address him directly 'take your girl home'. He makes a half hearted attempt while she's still screaming this on top of her lungs about how I'm being a racist piece of shit while waving her hands in my face. Then as I start walking away, she grabs me, i take her wrist and calmly tell her 'go home before the cops show up and you sit in a cell until Monday'. \nMeanwhile my manager has long since noticed and comes out and tells me to swap places and that he'll handle it. I go in and less than 15 seconds, he starts dialing Vegas' finest. Subsequently, she absconds in seconds. \nDuring all of this, a few dark skinned guys who aren't drunk and hostile come up, get carded an proceed to enter. She didn't notice, being wrapped up in telling me what a racist piece of shit I was.\n\nTL;DR:",

My son is a teenager, he went to spend the weekend with his mother on Friday evening. One of his half-brothers is there also. Saturday afternoon my son calls and says he wants to come home because mom went to a party and won't be back for ~8 hours. He says his oldest step-brother (19) will come pick up both boys, and bring my son home. I communicate with everyone to make sure we're all on the same page.\n\nHere's where it goes all pear-shaped. My son and his step-brother are waiting to be picked up when an older kid shows up. He shows them a pistol, asks them for their phones. The boys say they don't have any phones, just clothes and toys, and the older kid leaves. The boys call the cops, who show up and take statements. The cops then leave. Older step-brother arrives shortly and brings my son home.\n\nI just found out about this tonight from my son. Nobody involved (my son, either of his brothers, his mom, or the police) had said anything to me Saturday night. So right now I am pretty emotional. And I haven't calmed down enough yet to talk to his mom about it but she's going to get several earfuls from me.\n\nSo -- first, how do I follow up with the police department about this? I want a full report.\n\nBeyond that, I'm sure as I calm down I'll think of some ways to respond to this...but it would be good to have some input from other folks. Suggestions and ideas are welcome.\n\nTL;DR:",

It was old and the frame collapsed and the middle was all sunken anyways. His parent's got him a new bed for his birthday. It isn't the bed he had suggested. His dad went out and bought the firmest mattress at costco. We were laying on it that first night and at 3am he finally rolled over and said we were going to walmart to get an air mattress because the bed was so fucking painful to sleep on. We told his parents. They got us two toppers for it. \n\nFor him, it's better. For me I always wake up with an incredibly sore back. We tried a third topper on top of the other two. Not great and expensive. He suggested he buy a new mattress but this one was a gift from his parents and brand new. It is too late to exchange it. My idea was to maybe buy a cheap but comfortable twin mattress and push it up against his, but that also sounds ridiculous. My back hurts and it's getting irritating but since I'm only there on the weekends, I don't feel I have any right to tell him what to do with his bed. What do?\n\nTL;DR:",

        "Throwaway for obvious reasons.\n\nHere's the story:\n\nMy friend (lets call him Gary) started dating this girl (lets call her Francine) since December of last year (so around 9 months together).  Recently, they started going to different schools (same state, a 10 minute car drive). \n\nFrancine started talking to another guy (lets call him Donald) at her new school.  They then decided to take a break.  She told me that she was not ready for a long-term relationship, and that she wanted time to discover herself without any influences from other people.  Class schedules were difficult for the both of them, and they couldn't take the time and meet up (although I'm not really sure why).     \n\nLater, Francine broke up with Gary, and Donald broke up with his girlfriend (we'll call her Hillary) so they could be together.  This was very sudden for Gary. \n\nHillary then told Francine that Donald just wanted to have a relationship based off of sex with her, so Francine got back together with Gary (Francine didn't want a relationship based off of sex).  The time frame between them breaking up and getting back together was about 3 days, and Francine kissed Donald during this time.  Even after getting back with Gary, she still talks/texts with Donald frequently.     \n\nI don't know what Francine told Gary after they got back together, but it's clear to me that Gary does not know why Francine broke up with him.  \n\nGary thinks that Francine broke up with him because of the reasons stated in paragraph 2.  Francine actually broke up with Gary because she met Donald.  To me though, it seems like Francine really does love Gary in the end.  It just doesn't make sense to me why she was around with Donald for the duration.      \n\nShould I tell Gary why Francine broke up with him?  Or should I keep it to myself, and let them be together.",

Skidded across the hood of the car and landed on my back/shoulder. I sprang to my feet and was completely in shock. This old man steps out of the car and asks if I'm okay to which I respond yes (not really thinking, just happy to be alive). He then mutters that it isn't his first time hitting someone. I turn around to investigate the damage done to my bike and I hear the car door close. Next thing you know he peels off and totally ditches!\n\nNow that doesn't piss me off because I did say I was fine, but when I got home and opened my backpack my laptop was destroyed from me falling on it. I didn't get a license plate number because I was in shock and he just bolted the scene (plus who really thinks of this when you just get hit by a car).

Me and my girlfriend (now of six years) came back from a date night and proceeded to go to my room for some \"alone time.\"  I lived with three other guys at the time, all of which were home at the time. I also lived in the basement and had a full sized recessed window. Right next door to my room was a small apartment complex, but their line of sight is usually blocked by a pretty overgrown collection of trees and bushes and I had never had a problem. Fast forward a bit and we are laying in bed. I hear people walking around outside of my window with flashlights. We are not clothed, by the way. I get up and look out the window and then a cop hits the window (I can't see past the light and I didn't know it was a cop). I yell out a \"WHAT THE FUCK!?\" they yell back \"answer your front door, it's the police.\" I scramble on clothes and run upstairs to one of my roommates finally opening the front door and I run up, a bit angrily, and stop the officer from coming inside and ask him what the problem is. He asks me if I have a girl over. I said my girlfriend is downstairs. He then asks to talk to her. I ask why he needed to talk to her. He says my neighbor claims to have seen me raping an underage girl. I explain to them that my girlfriend is actually two months older than me- I was 22 at the time, but she looks a bit younger. My girlfriend came upstairs and the three cops just give me this look. She gives them her ID and then they all just start laughing. I'm a little angry about it all and I just stared at them. One cop just says \"Come on man, it's kind of funny when you think about it.\"  And it was, but I wasn't laughing at the time.\n\nTL;DR:",

        "Write an excellent summary of the given text.\n\nTitle: TIFU by not standing up for my coworker\n\nText: Like most of these, they didn't happen today this event happened yesterday and is irritating me to the point of not sleeping. So just some backstory my coworker we will name her Jill(not real name) has worked at that gas station that I had worked at for the past year. She is a very worrisome person and she can't help it. Now Jill and I are in a relationship and our boss who we will name Tina is truly a horrible person, and I thought I was a horrible person but no she takes the cake. She is a previous English teacher and is so condescending and patronizing. \nSo for the FU\n- Jill made a mistake on register which isn't that big of a deal just a lot of mistakes have been done in the last week and none were done by her besides this one. Our boss Tina decides to come out of her office and begin to patronize Jill and pushed her to the point of tears. She says well maybe you prepaid it wrong which she was correct, but then she continued and said I guess I'll check the tapes and found the mess up. And after Jill apologized and said I'm sorry I was wrong, Tina said and I quote, \"Maybe I outta slap some sense into you.\" Now I'm all for joking in the workplace but this crossed the line. There is a difference if a coworker said that to another coworker but a boss should NEVER say type of shit especially to a girl that you just pushed to the point of tears. So yea my fuck up was not saying anything to Tina about it. I know some might say it's not my place to say you're crossing the line. Jill and I have talked since work and she is planning on leaving this job and I fully support that decision, I am looking for a new job and saving money to afford to quit cause I'm poor with bills.\n\nTL;DR:",

While it was warming up I got a towel from the closet and undressed. I stepped into the shower and grabbed the bottle of shampoo I keep on the ledge. I squirt some into my hand, about the size of a quarter. I wet my hair and then rub in the shampoo. I scrub my hair and can feel all the suds forming on my head. After a few minutes of this I carefully rinse the soap out of my hair. I don't want to get it in my eyes. I then grab my bottle of conditioner and repeat what I did with the shampoo. This time though I leave it sit for a couple minutes so many hair can soak up those nutrients. I then rinse off again making sure there's no soap what so ever left.

I walked back towards the front door and went inside my house to open the letters I received in the mail. I opened the first letter, then the second, by the third letter I must have gotten distracted and ripped the envelope to quickly. That's when I felt the edge of the paper rip into my finger. Automatically, I reacted and dropped the letter on the table and saw the slit on my finger in which it started to bleed. I headed to the bathroom and in the medicine cabinet I pulled out the first aid kit. I rinsed my finger under warm water and disinfected it with alcohol. Then I patted dry my finger and opened an medium sized band aid to place it on my finger. I peeled the backing on the band aid and place it over the small cut on my finger. I wrapped my finger with the band aid and clean up. Then I headed back to open the rest of my mail.",

I try his phone again half an hour later, and he answers. I ask where he was, and he said he'd gone to the friend's house. I called the friend and asked if he ever showed, and he said no. I knew he was dishonest to a lot of people, but I always figured he could be straight with me. We would always have long talks about the state of things, how he feels about the family, etc...and this is the first time I accidentally caught him blatantly lying to me (I am 21, and feel so childish that I believed he was always honest with me).

Help with identification?\n\nText: So, I live in an apartment with three roommates. I moved in at the beginning of January, and since moving in I have received dozens of strange bug bites while I sleep. However, in attempting to identify the culprits, I have been unsuccessful. Here's the situation:\n\n* No one else in my apartment has gotten any bites. My roommates and I regularly cuddle and there has been no cross-contamination.\n* I was treated for scabies and took the necessary preventative measures to stop a relapse, but this was ineffective.\n* I switched out my mattress and my bed frame for completely new ones and have washed my sheets and blankets several times.\n* I have checked around the room for signs of bugs, but nothing has proved fruitful. I have seen no spiders, fleas, or mosquitos in all my time here.\n* I had a service come in and check for bed-bugs, and they couldn't find any. \n* When I visited my family for a week at home, I didn't receive any new bites, so whatever it is is definitely in the room.\n* Most of my bites appear on my arms and hands, if that is helpful...? Some on my feet and back as well. \n\nSo, what remains is this: Some sort of bug that is living in the room and does not spread easily. Advice? Similar stories? I'm getting pretty desperate here: I'm really tired of being itchy.\n\nTL;DR:",

The research questions were as follows: (a) to what extent do HNC patients report fear of cancer recurrence? (b) To what extent are fears of recurrence manifestations of illness-related anxiety? (c) Are fears of recurrence closely related to current symptoms, disease, and treatment-related factors, or psychological/socio-demographic factors? (d) What factors are predictive of long-term fears of recurrence?\", 'A prospective repeat measures design was employed whereby a sample of 82 newly diagnosed HNC patients (54 males, 28 females, mean age 60 years) completed measures of fears of recurrence, illness perceptions, coping, and anxiety and depression, prior to treatment and 6-8 months after treatment (fears of recurrence only).', 'A third of HNC patients at diagnosis reported relatively high levels of fears of recurrence, with 12% still reporting similar levels of fear 6-8 months after treatment. Fears of recurrence were not related to any socio-demographic factor (age, gender, ethnicity, marital status, and educational attainment) or disease, treatment, or symptom-related factors. Path analyses demonstrated that fears of cancer recurrence after treatment were directly predicted by pre-treatment fears and optimism.']",

That's happened before and it's been no big deal.\n\nBut this is how it usually goes for me:\n- Meet a guy\n- He starts texting/snapping me all the time with him initiating probably like 4 or 5x a day\n- We go out on a couple of dates and have a really good times\n- I start to like him and have a feeling he feels the same way\n- Texting/snapping still happens\n- We hookup usually around the 3rd or 4th date\n- He gets distant, the communication dwindles or if he does want to talk, it's only about sex \n- Everything stops, despite my attempts to get it back on track and I delete them\n\nIt's just SO heartbreaking to feel like you have a connection with someone, only to realize they only saw you as a conquest and all of the nice things they said and did were just to get you in bed. There are tons of girls out there who are willing to hook up but why manipulate the ones who clearly want something more?

With her on her red scooter and me on my blue scooter, we raced down the sidewalk at top speeds. Before I knew it, she began to wobble uncontrollably in front of me. She tried to jump off into the grass before crashing, but she landed hard on the pavement. I rushed to help her and noticed her knee was bleeding quite a bit. We walked slowly home to tend to her wounds. I took her into the bathroom and washed off her wound with soap and water. I then dried her wound with a clean towel. I reached into the cabinet and found the nearest bandages I could find. I peeled open the band-aid and took off the plastic strips.

I always find Tom Kha to be especially good as a cold remedy.  I had already been to the grocery store and gotten all the ingredients I needed.  I chopped up some lemongrass and ginger and started cooking them in some chicken broth with lime leaves.  While this was simmering, I chopped up some chicken, and placed that in the pot as well.  Then I added the coconut milk, fish sauce, and mushrooms.  I let it simmer for a while to let all the tastes blend. I occasionally tasted the soup, and added extra seasonings until it tasted just right.  The Tom Kha made a very tasty dinner.  I'm looking forward to having the leftovers for lunch tomorrow.",

I've had at minimum 30 packages delivered via UPS of which a grand total of 0 have ever shown up on my doorstep.  15 have shown up next door, 3 to the house behind me, 5 to the house on the other side of me, 3 to a house 4 houses down, 1 to the house across the street, 3 are still not known.  These are approximate numbers, give or take a package.\n\nNever once has UPS ever gotten the package to my door in my entire time living here.  I've had to go house to house when i have something delivered and have called the headquarters in Atlanta, talked to the VP of operations, called the local depot every single time, shown up there a dozen times, asked to leave for making a scene twice and left once when law enforcement was being called.\n\nStill, packages cannot find their way here.  I've yelled, fussed, bitched, complained, wrote letters, made phone calls, done everything I can and they still fail.  I've gotten to the point I avoid business that only use UPS online (and i email them to inform them of why i am not ordering from them) and with Newegg i have paid 40+ dollars for 3 Day Shipping with FedEx then to get free shipping with UPS.\n\nThis is, without doubt, a clear violation of the agreement upon which they enter when they become the supplier of said delivery services.  I did not start out with threats, i did not start out mean, but i've been pushed.  I've had enough.  What can I do legally to bring up charges against them.

We watch the cops show up, they talk for maybe a few seconds and the lady points back in to the neighborhood. They and the cops talk and laugh for a few more seconds and the cops leave.

Bobby and Tim usually jump on their bikes and ride down to the little convenience store.  When they get there, they park their bikes, and walk in straight to the vending  machine.  They put in their 10 cent dime into the machine, and press the button next to the candy or gum they want.  The candy pops out  of the bottom of the vending machine, and they usually get two pieces of candy each. They put the candy into their sack they brought with them, and walk around the store to see if they need anything else. Sometimes they also buy a drink for the way back home, especially if it is hot outside. As they leave the store, they wave to the lady at the counter, and thank her for her help.",

I drove to a mechanic to get the heating on my car fixed (foggy windows are starting to be an issue). It is Sunday and I figured 4 hours was enough time before the store closed to diagnose and hopefully fix the issue. I walked to a nearby restaurant had some lunch and went back and sat in their waiting area. They initially gave me an estimate of 1 hour. After 2.5 they told me the progress and that they were narrowing it down. After another hour they came out with a part and showed me what had happened but of course they didn't have a new part in the store. Luckily they said they could have it by Wednesday. The guy behind the counter also casually slipped in that my car was in pieces and the guy who took it apart already left for the night. My biggest mistake was doing it today; as tomorrow my first day at a new job with a significant commute. (2 hours in rush hour traffic, 1 with no traffic).\n\nTL;DR:",

The time limit was around an hour, and because I didn't study properly I was having a pretty tough time with some of the questions. I also hadn't yet pooped that day, so I was constantly squirming around uncomfortably trying not to prairie dog/cause a scene. About halfway through a really long essay question I decided to take a bit of a breather, and as I tipped my chair back to stretch my body decided to let out a long, whining fart. The room was pretty large and dead silent, so everybody could hear my high-pitched rectal turbulence. Of course I tried to cover it up by loudly coughing and squeaking my chair around, but it was no use as all the people in the area around me could smell the disgusting pre-poop stench. I don't feel as bad now though, because about 20 minutes later another girl let out a fart even more impressive than mine.\n\nTL;DR:",

I turned on the washing machine by setting the dial to the the amount of time to wash the clothes. I also set a knob for how full the washer was. I also set the temperature of the water.

We used to play this game in high school gym class called sardines. It's basically reverse hide-and-seek in the dark (everyone searching for one person). And I mean **dark**. All lights off, gym door windows covered, etc. No room adjoining with the gym is off-limits either. That means the changerooms, fitness centre, and emergency exit.\n\nSo I'm chatting with an acquaintance (we'll call her Cindy) and her friend (we'll call her Mindy) in the dark, because who wants to actually search for a person in the dark? We were in the fitness centre portion of the gym. I thought I felt someone behind me trying to get by, so I moved forward to give them room. Because it was dark, I kept my hands outstretched so I don't walk into a barbell benchpress or something and only bump it with my hand instead.\n\nI walked handfirst into something... I immediately withdrew my hand, not sure of what I touched. *Hm, soft and cloth-covered. Doesn't seem like a barbell benchpress...* At the same time, the Mindy sort of gasped. \"Who was that? Cindy, was that you?\" \"What are you talking about, Mindy?\" \"Someone just touched my boob!\".\n\n*shitshitshitshit* In the ensuing silence, I'm quickly going thru the options. I could own up, pretend it was someone else, or just nope my way out of there (it's dark, so they wouldn't notice my absence).\n\nI decide to come clean: \"Oh sorry, that was me.\"^(my best guess at her thoughts: \"dafuq?\")\n\n*silence*\n\nI mumble something about someone trying to get by.^(That still doesn't explain why you touched my boob) \n\n*silence*\n\n\"I was trying not to bump into anything.\"^(\"Great job! You're definitely a perv!\").\n\nAs I muttered sorry again, my voice died away into nothing, and I slunk away into the darkness like an ashamed ninja.^(\"God, he's a creep!\")\n\nTL;DR:",

Does no good deed go unpunished?\n\nText: So here's my situation: I was driving home about thirty minutes ago. While within thirty seconds of my apartment, I noticed that the car in front of me had a twitchy taillight. It was a remake Thunderbird from the early 00's, so the blinker and the taillight share the same housing. I flashed my brights as he turned in front of me (the second to last turn before I arrive home) to let him know that there was a problem with his car (didn't actually know it was a him at this point).\n\nAnother fifteen seconds pass, and I'm signaling before I make my last turn of the day. Stupidly, I again flash my brights, this time twice. Then I turn right.\n\nHe immediately slams on the brakes (he's in front of me at this point), and proceeds to follow me. Clearly, he's not a person pulling over to have a reasonable conversation. I pull over.  \n\nWhen he stops beside me, I signal for him to roll his window down. He gets out of his car. He's not a physical threat to me, but he's clearly angry. I yell from my open window that something's wrong with his taillight. He greets me with a dismissive \"yeah,\" and proceeds to mean-mug me until he gets back in his car. I gesture for him to go ahead, and he doesn't.  \n\nAs I'm presently in front of my house, and he won't leave, I keep driving (lady to protect). He follows me for a block and takes off in the opposite direction.\n\nAs my car was recently hit while parked, it's recognizable. I'm now worried he might come back, but I understand my fear is irrational. Just wanted to share my story so I could calm down.\n\nTL;DR:",

He ended up harassing her by constantly calling her work/showing up at her house. My mom ended up getting a retraining order.\n\nFast forward to when I was born, my Dad wanted to get custody over me which my mom did not want. I ended up being sent to a different country as a baby during the whole trial. When the court asked for the DNA test, not sure how they did this, my mom used a different kid for the test? So it ended up being in court that he is not my father.\n\nNow growing up I didn't know anything about the DNA testing, but I knew about the harassment and being sent to a different country. (I was sent back to my mom around the age of 1 once the case was done). My mom was honest in terms of that her and my Dad didn't work but I could meet him when I turned 18. She said it couldn't be before then or else he might try to get custody over me. Once I turned 18 she ended up telling me about the whole DNA thing, and how she feels horrible but is asking me to not meet my Dad as he might press charges against her if he found out that what she did was illegal.\n\nNow currently I'm 19 and am 100% sure I found the other side of my family through investigation. But now am unsure how I should even approach him? My mom has been abroad for the past 2 years and my relationship with her has gone down the drain, for other serious reasons.\n\nIn the end I'm just kind of lost at what I should do as I want to meet my Dad I never knew. And my whole life we've lived in the same town. And he lives only 10 minutes from my place. What should I do? Thoughts and opinions?\n\nTL;DR:",

My parents are divorced and have separate houses; my mother's house has a HUGE upstairs that is essentially its own apartment without a kitchen, and father lived alone in a 5-bedroom house.\n\nMy older sister lived at my mom's at that time, but was slowly moving over to live with my father (Who is pretty old) to help fix up the house before she and her then-fiancee bought it.\n\nSO.  I went home to spend the holidays with my family, and I was staying with my mom; my sister went to stay at our dad's while I was home.\n\nWhile I was home, I got my period.  NBD, shit happens.  So I'm in the bathroom looking for a tampon.  There's one of those plastic drawer-sets in the corner of the bathroom because there's really not much storage space, and I'm like \"That's gotta be it.\"\n\nTop drawer had makeup.\nMiddle drawer had lotions, etc.\nBottom drawer?\n\nSex toys.  Nothing but sex toys.  And right on the top?  A big ol' string of anal beads.  Now I know WAY more about my sister's sex life than I ever wanted to know.\n\nGod.  Dammit.\n\nTL;DR:",

Sad, scared, confused\n\nText: She's visiting from out of town, we were out for a long day with some drinks. She got really drunk, after getting her back to the car I'm having second thoughts about how appropriate I am to drive (always nervous about this). Ask if I can borrow her phone to see if there is a hotel near by we can maybe crash at, better than risking it. She FLIPS OUT on me, starts talking about how stupid I am, insisting she's going to drive my car home (has priors, no way). I get fed up, through the phone back at her (doesn't hit her). She goes nuts, kicks me, hits me, pulls my hair. Call my husband, says you sound ok to drive, just come home. I do, and it's an hour worth her saying \"You are the mo st selfish, manipulative person I have ever met. You need to get your life together. This is why you don't have any friends. Your husband doesn't deserve this (by the way, I hate your husband. You should be embarrassed of yourself. You can never have kids. Why do you think no one ever comes to visit you. You always have to be the victim.\" She sees I'm crying at some point and then the abuse slows down. Towards the end of the trip it's profound apologies. \nHonestly I want her out of my house. I want her to get a plane back tomorrow. My husband thinks I'm taking it too seriously. I feel like this is maybe a last straw with my blood family.

What are things we should look out for when selecting a body shop?\n\nText: Just some background..\nThe first time I put my car in the shop, it was in Tampa, FL. To make a very long story short (I can elaborate if necessary), they backed my car into a fence and destroyed the rear end. Afterwards, it took them over 3 weeks to fix the damage that they caused when they told me it would only take 1. Not only did it take a lot longer than planned but the work was also really shoddy.\n\nThe second time, I decided to get a paint job on the entire car (along with some other modifications, i.e. Clear Bra, PDR, and regular dent repair, etc). I was leaving town for a month so I decided to put the car in the shop when I left. The body shop owner reassured me that the car would be ready when I returned. It has now almost been a week after I was supposed to pick my car up (almost 5 weeks total) and it still isn't ready. The reasoning is that they ordered some parts from the dealership 2 weeks prior and they still haven't arrived. The clear coat and final polish isn't done and the Clear Bra hasn't been installed yet. I'm paying for a rental and quickly getting frustrated.\n\nI did plenty of research before selecting both body shops. What should we look for when searching for body shops? Are there tricks that body shops usually employ that we should look out for?\n\nTL;DR:",

        "My son and I decided that we wanted to go camping somewhere not too far from where we live. I looked online and found a campsite that had lots of activities. There was a lake and some biking trails so we would bring our swimsuits and our bicycles. The website said that the campground was first come first serve so we decided to get there early, around 3pm. We loaded the car with the tent and sleeping bags and some food to grill over the fire. When we got to the campground they assigned us a spot near the lake. We went to the campsite and unloaded our tent and set it up. We purchased some firewood at the store so we could have an evening fire. With things all ready for sleeping we put on our swimsuits and headed down to the lake. After our swim we went back to the campsite and started our fire. We made a nice dinner and read some stories before we went to bed. In the morning we rode our bikes on the bike trails and when we got back we pulled down the tent and packed up the car. It was a lovely camping experience.",

I had just moved back in with my folks after getting my degree and amassing the huge student loan debt that comes with it. After living on my own, or with room-mates for roughly four years, I'd become used to being able to act like a fucking weirdo at home with nobody around to witness it.\n\nAnyways, I was watching TV in my room while doing a bit of tidying up. Everyone else was gone, and I was entertaining myself by doing celebrity impressions making fun of the idiotic commercials that were on. One commercial in particular that I thought was incredibly stupid was for the Clear-Blue Pregnancy Test, which was advertised by some pompous British dame as \"The most technologically advanced pregnancy test ever created.\" \n\n\"Come on, it's not a new car, it's a fucking pregnancy test\", I thought to myself.\n\nSo I took a deep breath, and in my best Tricky Dick voice, bellowed at the television the following endorsement:\n\n\"IT'S THE MOST SOPHISTICATED PIECE OF PLASTIC YOU WILL EVER PEE ON!!! I'M RICHARD NIXON!!!!\"\n\nI then proceeded to make a loud, angry sound with my face that I can only describe as when somebody demonstrates the act of motor-boating.\n\nTo my dismay, the next thing I noticed out of the corner of my eye, was my dear mother standing in the doorway, mouth agape. I hadn't heard her walk into the house. Of course the commercial was long over, as if I could justify what the fuck I was doing. She simply turned around and walked out, leaving me attempting to babble some kind of explanation. We haven't spoken about it since. I'm surprised she didn't try to have me committed after that.\n\nTL;DR:",

I'm new to the forum and would really appreciate your advice. Does anybody have the same issue dealing with a friend who suddenly tries to push your buttons out of nowhere? This is exactly my situation.\n\nI'm out of town to meet my family and she invited me to a movie night with some friends. I politely declined, stating why I physically cannot be there. She replied \"I guess you just don't care about your friend anymore, but it's ok\". \n\nThe other day, I was bringing some of my guy friends to check out a new car that I purchased. That night when she found out (even though I friggin drove her around a week ago), she said \"You didn't even invited me after class, I see how it is\". Any normal individual making that statement would laugh it off just to maintain a conflict-free conversation and can even cleverly use it as a friendly joke, but NO she then kept silent afterwards, expecting me to feel like s*** about myself and apologize or something. She always finds a reason to automatically go into that self-pity mode and gets serious about it.\n\nAfter thinking about it, she always tries to make me angry just out of a normal conversation. I think I finally realize that she gets the pleasure from making other people feel like crap and upset about themselves, guilting them into thinking that they did something wrong regardless of the situation.\n\nThe negative energy really brought me down and made me frustrated. I did bring this up to her many times but she always tries to instigate crap out of nowhere and push my buttons from nothing.\n\nI feel like I'm afraid to cut her from my life since she seems like a perfect friend in every way except this vile personality.

I do/did try to converse with her through IM, but it's never satisfying because she *always* stops responding without warning (I presume she's just busy whenever that happens, but maybe I'm fooling myself? I mean, the notifications are *right there*, wth?)\n\nFast forward a year later, to now, still wondering if I should tell her, and when. The doubt is mostly because we haven't interacted much and I feel it might make the situation.....awkward, but also because I suspect she's already in a relationship (not certain).\n\nRight now, I'm thinking of calling her up and offering my time to chat over some coffee or something; see how that goes.\n\nSo, what should I do?

        "Last night my air conditioner stopped working. It was so hot and sweaty while I was sleeping. It was clear when I woke up that I was going to have to change my sheets! I took off the blankets, sheets and pillow cases. I took them all to the laundry room. I placed the into the washing machine. I added the proper amount of liquid laundry detergent. I like the stuff that has a really strong smell. I closed the lid and let it wash. After it was done, I removed them and placed the in the dryer with a fabric softener sheet. They took an hour to dry. I removed them while they were still warm and carried them to my room. I placed the fitted sheet on, as the corners played a game of popping off as I ran from corner to corner putting it back on. I then put the flat sheet on, the blankets on the pillow cases on and top a moment to lay on top of the fresh bedding and just smell it for a minute. That is the best smell in the world.",

The problem is that I had moved out of state about 2 weeks after it happend. I didn't leave because I was fearing legal action, I was drifting from house to house with my girlfriend after losing our apartment and her family friends invited us to live with them for a bit. About 4 months after I've already moved to a different state my mom calls me telling me I'm supposed to go to court. We had used the last of our money on train tickets to head out of state so I had no way of getting back to where the court hearing would be. I called the county court house asking what I should do and they gave me the number for the prosecuting attorney and said to talk to him. I called him multiple times every day for a week straight and left multiple messages and never got a call back until finally it was past the day of the hearing. I've been back in the state where the charge was filled for the past couple months and I've been trying to figure out what the fuck to do about this missed court date. How much trouble could I really be in, I'm scared as hell. This is my first run in with the law other then a smoking ticket when I was 16.\n\nTL;DR:",

I'm gone for less than 5 mins, 7 at most. I come home to find my 60$ bean bad ripped to pieces, all of those little fucking beanbag beans everywhere. And he pissed on the carpet. And there's the little fucker laying there chewing his bone all innocently. Now when I say the beans were everywhere, I mean everywhere and the worst part was my floor boards are those wood ones with the massive a lines missing inbetween each floor board so all the beans were in them.

For example, this past New Years Eve, I had a party booked on the rooftop of a hotel in Aukland, New Zealand to view the fireworks.  Well, the party wasn't what I had expected it to be (the rooftop was covered and didn't have a good view of the fireworks), and frankly, it ruined my evening.  My wife still attempted to have fun, but I could tell I was ruining her evening too, by not being into it.\n\nIn general I find it hard to get genuinely excited about things.  Maybe it comes from a desire of not being let down/disappointed by what does happen, or maybe I'm just getting older and more cynical. I do know that I feel that my day to day is happy, but whenever it's a day with a preconceived emotion attached to it (Birthday, Christmas, New Years, etc) I always feel pressured, and don't have a good time.\n\nTL;DR:",

How do I make it up to her?\n\nText: For thanksgiving, my wife \"Tess\" and I went over to my parents' house for the family dinner. Now at the dinner, my sister \"Maddie\" would be attending too. I don't get to see Maddie too often anymore so I was really glad to hear that. Tess, on the other hand, wasn't. In the past, Maddie and Tess have never really gotten along and often end up in some sort of argument one way or another, so when I had asked Tess that when she sees Maddie, if she could just try to get along with her instead of arguing and Tess just got upset, thinking that I was accusing her as being the cause. I told her that I wasn't and we eventually got past it and went to my parents' house.\n\nSo once we're at their house, everything's going smoothly and the dinner's going fine. While I was helping my mom out with the food, Maddie and Tess start bickering over politics and eventually, both of their voices keep getting louder and louder to where my brother had to go and pull me from the kitchen to tell me. So at that point, I pull Tess to the side and I'm already upset that she's making a scene and she's mad that I'm \"siding with Maddie\". I wasn't though, as I had my brother go talk to Maddie instead. We continued to argue and I became really frustrated with her and said that of course she wouldn't understand family get-togethers. What I said was a really low blow because Tess's family was emotional negligent and so that really upset her and for the rest of the time, she wouldn't talk to me or very much to anyone else either.\n\nNow we're home and she has refused to talk to me otherwise.

His girlfriend found out somehow and obviously it turned into a heated argument. She ended up kneeing him in the balls and in response he slapped her across the face. They both decided to go their own separate ways.\nA week later, he receives a text message from his ex-girlfriend with a picture of obvious bruising on her face. He said that he is now afraid that she'll report a lawsuit against him. He asked me what to do. I first asked him if he apologized to her, and he said that he did not, he didn't get a chance (bizarre tbh). He also said that he didn't deserve to get knee'd in the balls. I told him that may be sort of true, but since he cheated I understand why she did it. He just got extremely mad at me and asked \"so if she cheated on me, I deserve to hit her?\" He made a good point to be honest. Maybe I'm just being sexist (I think that's the word, sorry it's late can't think lol). He then proceeded to say that he's just gonna file a lawsuit before she does, stating that he has bruising on his balls.\n\nWhat do you guys think?

I'm minding my own business, sanding away and then the board slips out of my grip flying towards the teachers rib cage(pretty fast as well).

It hits him in his gut and he stands there holding his gut, and tells me to go to the office, groaningly.\n\nI tell the Assistant Principal what happened and he suspends me for 4 days because \"I wasn't using the shop equipment correctly, as I was taught).

What fucked up things have you're friends done/said to your face?\n\nText: I was hanging out with a group of what i thought were fairly close friends (i've known for upwards of 3 years) at a bonfire which took place at one of their houses. One of the guys who wasn't there was hanging out with a girl that another one of our friends didn't particularly care for because she stabbed him with a pen in reaction to a practical joke. We didn't feel like bringing this kid over to the bonfire because we knew the girl he was with would start problems (the guy and the girl who weren't at the bonfire don't drive), so when they hit up everyones phone but mine for a ride, nobody responded. I make a comment on the fact that he didn't call my phone saying \"He probably thinks I'm still at work thats why he's not calling me, lucky break eh?\" (this being said in jest of course). The friend out of the group that I met first and certainly was the closest to promptly says \"Well no-offense to you dude, but your kinda just a wheel in our group anyway. I honestly would've forgot to call you to come to this bonfire if (other friend at the bonfire) didn't tell me to invite you.\" This can be taken in one of two ways 1. I drive the group around a lot so i could be just a driver 2. I'm the newest guy in the group so I don't really matter that much to them (think like the third wheel effect if that makes more sense than how I'm explaining it). Either way it was meant in my head, I still took it offensively because it was a very brutal thing to say to someone, especially someone you hangout with a lot, I didn't show it at the bonfire so I just behaved regularly and left when it was appropriate.

If the result were to be the same, then it wasn't worth it.  But nothing can change that fact that the war did happen.  We just hope you support us and see it through to the end.\n\nOther comments:  The Iraqis I talked to by and large are grateful that Saddam is gone.  They just wish that America understood Iraq better before invading or had a better plan.  They fully recognize that a large majority of the violence (death, destruction) is Iraqi verses Iraqi, and is not perpetrated or the fault of Americans.  They are tired of years of violence among the extremist groups, and crave safety and stability.\n\nTL;DR:",

I'm confused.\n\nText: Gf of 4 years asked me if it would bug me if she went to a strip club with her male coworkers. I guess it something they do once in while at her office. She's the only girl there.  I told her that it would bug me.  She asked me why and I told her I wasn't comfortable with her going to a sexually charged environment with a bunch of guys.\n\n  She said strips clubs aren't sexual for women as opposed to men and that she wouldn't be mad if in the future I ever went to one with my friends . I've never been to one but I admitted it wasn't out of the realm of possibility since bachelor parties sometimes involve strip clubs. In the end I told her that I don't want to be with a girl that was completely OK with going to a strip club with male friends/coworkers. I told her that if it was with female friends I'd be less uncomfortable with it but that not what she was originally asked about.\n\n  She said I was being unreasonable and that I was promoting a double standard. She also didn't like what she considered an ultimatum from me. She then asked me if I thought she belonged to me.  I admitted that I saw her as belonging to me (as in MY gf) but I also told her that she was free to do whatever she liked but  to not expect me to pretend everything was OK afterwards. The topic was dropped soon after but now I feel something is wrong here. \n\n I feel like I don't see my gf the same way now.  I never really imagined she would ever want to even be in a strip club with a  bunch of guys because she's always complaining about how guys can be \"such creeps\".  Why would she even want to go?  She says it would be \"funny\"...  I don't get it.\n\nTL;DR:",

        "So I'm sure this is a story as old as time, but recently I found out that my gf has been texting old flings from college. Some are innocent enough, like a text asking an old friend/fling to grab a slice of pizza for lunch near where they work, but one particular case has got me feeling pretty down. She texted this one guy about 2 weeks ago and pretty quickly escalated to telling him how she found old letters from him and how sometimes she wonders \"what if?\" Saying things like \"I know I shouldn't be texting you, but I can't stop. I like talking to you too much.\"\n\nThis was all news to me considering up until now I thought we had a picturesque relationship. After bringing it up with her, she basically said that she was really sorry for what she did and that she was just uncertain if we were really meant to be together and that this was her way of telling if maybe we weren't. She said that she basically came to the conclusion that she wasn't interested in that guy and that she is truly and really committed to me.\n\nThis is great but now I'm not certain how to feel. I told her I still love her and want to stay together but that I'll need some time to completely get over it. Do you guys think this would qualify as a form of emotional cheating? Nothing actually happened, and the texting seems to have stopped after a couple days of mild flirting, but I still can't help but feel betrayed.",

I was washing dishes and trying to be the best husband ever by cleaning the house today.  I set up my daughter with a show to watch and made her a fort with blankets to watch it from.  \n\nI start on some dishes when I get interrupted while the sink is filling with water. \"Daddy my fort broke\"  I told her i would fix it when I finished the dishes.  After about 15 minutes I go into the room and can't find her.  I call out her name, ..... nothing.  I yell her name, ...... nothing.  I run outside and start screaming her name, ....... \"She's at the park\"  Some guy from the of the street yelled back.  I dash to the park as fast as I could.  Now I'm about 100 pounds overweight, I surprised the absolute fuck out of myself.  I never thought I could run that fast or for the long in my condition. \n\nAnyways the school across the street is having their field day.  Here comes a large man in basketball shorts and a t-shirt (no shoes) running yelling his daughters name. Most everyone is looking at me.  I ask the first adult I see if they have seen a small child.  My daughter is about to turn 4 and it doesn't help that she is 3'9\" already and wears 5-6 clothing.  They probably thought she was a kindergartner.   The man replied to me that he hasn't to which another woman replies oh that must be scary.  Not my initial thought but in retrospect DUH!!!  Anyways at this point I see my daughter running across the bridge on the playground.  I run over grab her by the hand and make the walk back home.\n\nI was absolutely terrified.

Reddit, what is the strangest way someone has ever woken you up?\n\nText: So basically my girlfriend and I go back to her place after enjoying a lovely meal at our local Korean restaurant. Having settled down to sleep for about twenty minutes, we begin to hear a scratching noise at the door. I ignore it for a minute or two but it continues, and eventually the handle slowly slides down and a figure topples through the doorway. The light spilling in from the hallway reveals a guy I know from school, an acquaintance who I haven't seen in around two years because he's been travelling the world. \n\nThough slightly surprising, this alone is not particularly shocking to us as he's a good friend of my girlfriend's housemate and is clearly just blind drunk and lost on his way to the bathroom. What is slightly more surprising, however, is what happens next. Clearly realising that he is in the wrong place but obviously incapable of doing anything about it, he proceeds to curl into a ball on the floor, pull down his pants and then piss for about a minute and a half, all over my girlfriends carpet. We then wake up her housemate, who drags him into the hallway where he carries on pissing for around another minute. He then tries to re-enter the room, naked from the waste down and shouting \"it doesn't even matter!\" and other, slightly less coherent phrases. I'm posting this as he has FINALLY gone to bed after much cajoling and I can't really sleep, partly because it was a hugely traumatic/hilarious experience and partly because I can't really wait for him to wake up tomorrow to the news that he pissed all over my girlfriend's apartment. As an added twist, he's been away so long that we're not even sure that he knows that me and her are going out or that he even saw me last night in his drunken, urine-spraying rage. Tomorrow is set to be fun.\n\nTL;DR:",

        "1 WASHINGTON - They are all 'veterans of the tobacco wars,' as Sen. Richard J. Durbin of Illinois put it.\n2 Over the years, they have sponsored legislation to ban smoking on airplanes, led efforts to remove depictions of tobacco use in films and successfully sued the tobacco industry for misleading the public about the dangers of smoking.\n3 And at a recent hearing, the trio of Democratic senators - Durbin, Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut - grilled executives from an industry they said was selling an unhealthy product and an unsafe message to young people.\n4 But the subject of their ire was not tobacco.\n5 It was energy drinks - sweetened beverages with large doses of stimulants for quick energy boosts that have become increasingly popular over the last decade, particularly with high school and college students who often use them to study late into the night.\n6 The hearing was the most notable battle so far in the senators' latest campaign: to limit access by minors to the beverages.\n7 Energy drink companies contend the effort is misguided and overstates the health risk of caffeine to teenagers.\n8 But Durbin, Markey and Blumenthal are drawing upon their previous fights against the sale and advertising of cigarettes to children under age 18.\n9 They have called upon the Food and Drug Administration to investigate the safety of energy drinks and urged high school and college sports organizations to educate their athletes on the risks of combining the beverages with physical activity.\n10 Now they are focusing their efforts on the industry's marketing techniques, which they claim are targeting young consumers.\n11 At a recent hearing, Markey displayed photos from energy drink companies' Facebook pages that showed children posing with cans of their products at public events.\n12 He recalled the efforts of the tobacco industry to attract young smokers to replace older customers who were dying off.\n13 'Hook 'em early, keep 'em for life,' he said.\n14 'Makes a lot of sense to me as a marketing promotion'.\n15 The campaign on energy drinks began early last year after the death of 14-year-old Anais Fournier.\n16 The Maryland teenager, who had a malfunctioning valve in her heart, went into cardiac arrest after she apparently consumed two 24-ounce cans of Monster energy drink in a 24-hour period.\n17 Her death certificate cited 'cardiac arrhythmia due to caffeine intoxication'.\n18 The two drinks contained 480 milligrams of caffeine, equal to the amount found in about 14 cans of soda and five times the American Academy of Pediatrics' daily recommended allowance for adolescents.\n19 Monster Beverage Corp. has repeatedly denied any link between its product and Fournier's death.\n20 'It struck me that we were back into the same problem' with energy drinks as with cigarettes, Durbin said in an interview.\n21 Young customers were unaware the drinks 'had never been tested for safety or effectiveness' by the FDA.\n22 The senators became especially concerned after a report from the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration showed the number of emergency room visits involving energy drinks doubled to nearly 21,000 from 2007 to 2011.\n23 About 1,500 of those visits were by children ages 12 to 17.\n24 Medical professionals tend to agree that energy drinks are unsafe for minors, who are more vulnerable to adverse health effects from large amounts of caffeine.\n25 The energy drink industry disputes those claims, arguing that caffeine has been studied for decades and is safe for consumption.\n26 Rodney Sacks, chairman and chief executive of Monster Beverage, said during the Senate hearing that the company's products contain about 10 milligrams of caffeine per ounce, about half the level of caffeine in most coffee served in coffee bars.\n27 He and other industry officials argued that teens consume far more caffeine from coffee, tea and soft drinks.\n28 Blumenthal acknowledged in an interview that the threat from energy drinks was not as severe as from cigarettes.\n29 'Tobacco kills the consumer,' he said.\n30 'Energy drinks can be bad for kids, but they are not as lethal as tobacco.\n31 Nor are they as addictive'. The senators are still disturbed by common promotional tactics of the energy drink industry: buying advertising on youth-oriented networks such as MTV, funding development programs for teenage athletes, and sponsoring concerts, sporting and gaming events that attract adolescents.\n32 Blumenthal likened the strategy to tobacco companies' use of mascots, such as cowboys and cartoon characters, that young people would find cool.\n33 For energy drink companies 'to deny that they're appealing to children, it's more than a little disingenuous,' he said.\n34 Industry officials said at the Senate hearing that their target customers are men between 18 and 35.\n35 They argued that their advertising is aimed at sporting events with broad appeal, such as the X Games and NASCAR, and is not trying to target adolescents.\n",

You know that \"gut feeling\" everyone says they have when they are asked, \"How did you know she/he was cheating on you?\" Well I have that feeling all the time. Whether it be a missed call from an unknown number, to the passenger seat in his car not being positioned exactly as I remembered it.\n\nI conjure a lot of shit up in my head. I know a lot of it is in my head. He's never cheated, but I can't shake that \"gut feeling\" whenever something seems off.\n\nWhenever something 'abnormal' occurs, my instinct tells me he's cheating on me.\n\nAll my insecurities and accusations have pushed him away. It's taken several months for us to get back to normal and rebuild our relationship. When my insecurities are gone, our relationship is amazing; he is responsive, loving, caring, and open again. But the second I start bringing up the past, accusing him of things, he pulls back and I can tell he loses hope in us.\n\nPlease help. How do I push these thoughts out of my head. I know tonight is just one of those nights when my insecurities are trying to take over me. This isn't a situation where I have loads of proof of him cheating. It's just an instance, but I need help calming my brain and making that \"gut feeling\" shut up before I say something stupid.\nI don't want to rock the boat over something so stupid. I'm so mad at myself for thinking this way.\n\nHarsh advice wanted. Anything to make my head shut up.\n\nTL;DR:",

Sadly it was right before Sandy hit (the company is right on wall street) and I didn't hear from them for three weeks. I was about to give up when I got a call in for a second interview.\n\nMy second interview lasted about about two hours, give or take. I met with the head of marketing a second time, then the head of sales (I met him back in June) and then I unknowingly spoke with the VP for about an hour before I left.

This was from about a year after I had started learning. Our teacher (Let's call him Mr. A) was a crazy, yet good music teacher. He hated the basses. \n\nOne day, I was tuning, and I kept twisting the string, but it wouldn't go much higher. I got my friend's tuner and kept twisting. \n\n[There are 4 strings on most basses, the E, A, D, and G. I was twisting the D string, while trying to tune the G string.]\n\nSince I was so focused on the tuner, I didn't notice that much how it was getting tighter and tighter. \n\nSuddenly, BANG, it snapped. \n\nOur teacher was just walking in from his office, which was connected to the band room. Everyone got quiet and stared at me.\n\nHe started lecturing me on how these were the school's instruments and how they were not cheap (bass strings cost about 20 bucks) It was mortifying.

What do we do?\n\nText: Let me start that me and Joe know Michael for a very, very long time. Especially me. When I was around six, and Michael around five, we used to play a lot together with my nephew. Michael seemed a normal kid at first, but one time my aunt caught him trying to shove his hand down my underwear. ''Let me feel for a second,'' he said. My aunt separated us and never bothered to tell his parents. Michael also used to be fond of very unusual games. He and my nephew used to play hide and seek, but Michael always said: ''If I find you, you have to take your clothes off.'' \nWell, fast forward a couple of years later. I'm around twelve, and my best friend Joe meets Michael. They are in the same class. They befriend each other and I befriend Michael. I didn't know he tried to molest me at that time, I found that out later. My mom told me. My mother is now dead by the way, so I can't ask her advice, unfortunately. So we're all in the same school together. Then, one year later, Michael's sister says she's being abused at home. This immediately rings a bell. Nobody believes her. Then, one day she says she lied all of it. I still don't believe that. I think she said that because nobody believed her. So, this is very suspicious. I decided to tell Joe and he was quite shocked by what he heard from me. Especially because Michael seems like such a normal kid. We decide to do nothing, but now, a couple of years later (me and Joe both sixteen, Michael fifteen), we have another proof of ''evidence''. Michael was having severe nightmares, and told his mother. Who said: ''Maybe they're about your dad?'' BOOM. That's all. Michael doesn't even ask trough? I asked Michael what the nightmares were about, he didn't know. \nSo, me and Joe think Michael was molested by his dad, but now can't remember. Or something like that. We don't know what to do. It's not like we have good proof or whatever, and any advice is REALLY welcome. Like, really, REALLY welcome.\n\nTL;DR:",

It's been over a week since we last bumped uglies, and we're both little horn dogs. So, randomly this morning while at work, he suggested we book a hotel tonight.\n\nExcept, it's at a seedy, cheap Motel 6 and we only have an hour. Why? Because it's Good Friday, and being from a family with extremely Catholic parents, I have to be at church this evening in my town - 50 minutes away from work/hotel. I'm wearing granny panties (hey! I didn't think anyone would see me naked today), so I ran to a sex shop during lunch and bought some lingerie. Plus, his sister just had a baby this morning, and we have to visit her and our first nephew...which kind of ups the \"we shouldn't be doing this\" level to me. Visit an innocent little baby then go have rough sex at a random hotel? \n\nAll this feels so wrong, but oh so right :)\n\nTL;DR:",

Let's call her Sarah. She's from Seattle. She's a bit of a trouble-maker and very curious which is a dangerous combination. Since she wasn't allowed to bring many dolls or anything, I'm her new toy and she keeps inappropriately grabbing my ahem, chestal region and keeps trying to pass it off as touching my shirt or flicking away a monster. Where I fucked up is, since she's a guest at my house and my mum doesn't want any drama, I somehow rationalised in my head to just say to her, \"Don't do that, Sarah, you'll understand when you're older why that's inappropriate and if you do it again, I'll tell your mum.\" (scariest threat that I can give a kid, right?) Well, it didn't work.\n\nAnyway, so I had to sit a three hour practice exam and in the morning, I just throw on the comfiest looking clothes that I could find. Honestly my clothes were a little too tight, since I've kind of grown around my breasts lately and I haven't had the time to purchase a bunch of new clothes. So when I get in the car, my mum, dad, aunt, two cousins, Sarah and her brother, Scott and my grandma when I was expecting just mum to pick me up. She starts pointing at that area without saying anything, in front of everyone. I was kind of naive because I was still clinging onto the hope that she was somewhat a good girl and look down to see if there was actually something for a little too long until her brother (my cousin) blushed really hard and says, \"Sarah, you can't point there!!!!\" Mum, dad, and grandma stayed eerily and judgingly quiet. My aunt was furious.\n\nI felt kind of humiliated for dressing so inappropriately in front of my family but her mum (my aunt) gave her a stern talk and punishment about why it was rude of her to do. She hasn't done it since... To be fair, it's been two days but progress right?\n\nTL;DR:",

Last night he wore his favorite pajamas with Lightning McQueen from the movie \"Cars\".

We then read a bedtime story, last night was Goodnight Fish, which was a book he got when he and his grandparents went to visit the aquarium.

He's amazing and wonderful and we fit together like two puzzle pieces. \n\nLately Jacob's been going through a lot of family problems.  His one grandma recently has been affected by a stroke and barely made it, and his other suffers from alzheimer's.  However I think it's his brother that impacts him the most.  We'll call his brother Kevin.  \n\nKevin lived out of the house for a while but recently moved back in at home. He is an alcoholic and is also a drug user, i think heroin based on his actions.  \n\nKevin drinks and uses in the house and Jacob is constantly seeing his decline and its killing him.  He's broken down crying in front of me and punched walls causing his hands to bleed.  Hes said how he just hopes his brother \"ODs\" and other things.  \n\nHe tells me hes depressed and he hates his life.  Sometimes when hes stressed he takes it out on me and yells at me.  He immediately apologizes and says he hates how he does that bc it just makes him feel worse. Jacob has also talked about taking a break or breaking up, but this has only come up once about a month ago and Im pretty sure it came from the stress from home issues considering how great of a relationship we have. But It hurts me beyond words to see someone i love just suffering so much and i want to help but im not sure how. \n\nJacob doesnt like talking about his feelings so when things happen I try to ignore it and distract him by getting him out of the house...

She asked me to boil some potatoes to eat for dinner, she had already peeled them and everything so all I had to do was stick 'em in water, wait for them to boil and turn the gas off when they do. Easy right?\n\nI turn the gas on, put the potatoes in a pot to boil, put the pot on the stove and sit down in the kitchen to do some homework. After a while of this I realise I need to grab a book from upstairs. I check the potatoes to make sure that they're not boiling yet - they're not and go upstairs. After I come back down I continue to do homework and keep checking the potatoes every now and again.\n\nAfter a while of this going on I start to notice a faint burning smell. I check on the potatoes again... and all the water has boiled out of them. I have no idea how this happened and start to panic because my dinner is burning and mum will get pissy. I reasoned that the problem was that the water had boiled out of the pot so the solution must be to put water back into it. I also realised that I should put hot water back into the pot so that it doesn't get damaged.\n\nAt this point I should mention that at that time i was living in a third world country at that our tap water was really quite shitty and not good enough for cooking, instead we used water from a [cooler] So I pick the pot up, put it on the stand of the cooler (the plastic bit under the taps) and start to pour hot water on the potatoes. Crisis averted right?\n\nWell no, the potatoes were still pretty burnt. After filling the pot up again, I try to pick it up again and to my surprise I can't. At first I was a little confused, then I realised that the stand was plastic, the pot was hot and that's not a good mixture.

However, the criteria used in the selection process often are subjective and studies have differed in terms of which criteria predict either objective measures or subjective ratings of resident performance by faculty.QUESTIONS/', 'Do preresidency selection factors serve as predictors of success in residency? Specifically, we asked which preresidency selection factors are associated or correlated with (1) objective measures of resident knowledge and performance; and (2) subjective ratings by faculty.', 'Charts of 60 orthopaedic residents from our institution were reviewed. Preresidency selection criteria examined included United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE) Step 1 and Step 2 scores, Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) scores, number of clinical clerkship honors, number of letters of recommendation, number of away rotations, Alpha Omega Alpha (AOA) honor medical society membership, fourth-year subinternship at our institution, and number of publications. Resident performance was assessed using objective measures including American Board of Orthopaedic Surgery (ABOS) Part I scores and Orthopaedics In-Training Exam (OITE) scores and subjective ratings by faculty including global evaluation scores and faculty rankings of residents. We tested associations between preresidency criteria and the subsequent objective and subjective metrics using linear correlation analysis and Mann-Whitney tests when appropriate.', 'Objective measures of resident performance namely, ABOS Part I scores, had a moderate linear correlation with the USMLE Step 2 scores (r = 0.55, p<0.001) and number of clinical honors received in medical school (r = 0.45, p<0.001). OITE scores had a weak linear correlation with the number of clinical honors (r = 0.35, p = 0.009) and USMLE Step 2 scores (r = 0.29, p = 0.02). With regards to subjective outcomes, AOA membership was associated with higher scores on the global evaluation (p = 0.005). AOA membership also correlated with higher global evaluation scores (r = 0.60, p = 0.005) with the strongest correlation existing between AOA membership and the \"interpersonal and communication skills\" subsection of the global evaluations.']",

He sort of puttered around the answer, and I just told him that I'm fine with what you decide on, I just need to know for my own sake. He said he wasn't interested in being in a serious relationship, but he didn't want to stop seeing me. I was okay with this, and eventually we talked it out to make the decision that we were going to be exclusive but that this was just casual. We were already having sex at this point, so it was sort of a relief to hear the exclusivity since I don't want to be slept around on. \n\nAfter that, we continued to see each other, and more and more frequently. I'm currently spending the night at his place almost every other night when possible ( we both work late nights). I really enjoy being with him, and realized this even more so when he went on vacation for a week recently, and didn't have much contact with him since he was on a cruise. \n\nPhysically, he's always touching me in subtle ways, or playing with my hair, or just holding my hand. When I spend the night, it's not always for sex, but just to be with each other. He takes me to events with his friends, and I do that as well when mine are in town. \n\nI honestly didn't expect to feel anything romantically for him, and just wanted to enjoy his company/regular sex in the beginning. But now I'm  I'm feeling more for him than I should feel I something casual, and am wondering when is the right amount of time to ask about the two of us. I need to know if this is just casual for him. If it is, should I break up with him knowing that it will be better now than if I actually fell in love with him down the road? I don't want to get caught off guard, but how proactive about this should I be? Is 3 months too short, too long to be thinking about this?\n\nTL;DR:",

We both work full time but she gets home about two hours earlier than me most nights, but for me it varies a lot. It's a 30 minute drive home but sometimes I get off at 5, other times I stay until nearly 6:30 and don't get home until 7.\n\nI got a text today on my lunch break from her saying to text her when I am about to head home from work. I replied saying that I would probably get off at 5:30 tonight, she replied saying to text her when I am getting in the car to go home. It's nearly 5 now and I haven't replied. I keep getting this niggling thought in the back of my brain that she has another man over, and she wants me to text her when I am going home so that she has enough time to get him out of the house and hide the evidence.\n\nIt's not that I think that my wife is a cheater, but my parents are divorced because my dad cheated and it basically ruined my childhood. So even though I think it is a small chance that she would do this the ramifications of her cheating are huge. I am trying to think of why she would need to know the exact minute I get home but everything I can think of is nefarious.\n\nDo I text her? Don't? I told her 5:30 earlier, I could take some of my work home and leave at 5 tonight, that could catch her by surprise and confirm my suspicions or settle my fears if it's nothing.

What do I do?\n\nText: On Friday night, I was hanging out with four of my best friends. We were at a wal-mart plaza when one of my friends suggested that we should buy spray paint and go around and tag buildings and shit. Obviously this was a stupid idea, but to my friends, I guess it wasn't. So, my friends decided to buy it, and they wanted to go to an elementary school we used to go to and spray the hell out of it. Now, I didn't want to do this and if I didn't I guess I was being a pussy. It was almost 10pm at the time, and my Mom texted me to be home before then, so I did.\n\n   The next day, I was hanging out with two of my friends who sprayed the school, and they showed me where they sprayed the paint. We went to the school and they wrote racial slurs, a swastika and other really dumb things. Now, my friends weren't racist or anything, I just think they wrote that crap because they wanted to be known, or cool or something. I told them how they were fucked in the head for doing it, but they didn't think so. Anyways, we went back to one of my friends house, and around 9 or 10 o'clock pm, 2 police officers came to the door and asked for my friends. They both went outside talking to them for about 20 mintues, when both of my friends came inside and said they were going to the station. After that, I went back home and my friend messaged me saying they might get charged and are going to court in June. I feel extremely lucky that I wasn't there, but I also feel bad for my friends and what they're going through. They aren't bad guys, or assholes, or a bunch of racist dudes or anything. They're pretty good guys, and I feel like they don't deserve it that bad. \n\nSo, should I be worried, because I'm kind of sketching out pretty hard.

I went to the police and reported it but the DA basically said that there was not enough to prosecute the case, because it was an acquaintance rape case. Despite the fact that I was covered in bruises, and I had his semen on my clothes.

I managed to get through it. Anyways--I brought charges to him through the school  judicial hearing..which was terrible in it's self. The school found him guilty and only gave him a semesters suspension. To this day---I am scared to death of him. (He's 500 miles away) and he completely believes he was innocent and that I made it all up. \n\nAnyways--I have not really had a relationship since then, and sex is still weird sometimes because I have flashbacks during it (i work through them though and try to shake it off).

For days it seemed as vivid as a dream.  \n\nSo I've known Taylor for nearly a decade; only becoming friends a few years from now. Through art class is where we bonded in group projects, not really knowing others in the class too well (split class). I have a sick sense of humor and a plethora of sarcasm; I teased her, but always made her laugh. Remained partners in nearly all projects for the year without romance ever coming once in my mind.  \n\nNow just a week ago, we were working after school, alone in the art studio (done this myriad times). A tense feeling swam in the air as we worked and joked around (almost seducing in manner). Sitting beside each other, I decided to grow a pair of nuts and at least bring the subject up. I remained myself though, a comedian with shaky hands (even feinting a confession with the reveal as an unrelated, stupid question. e.g. \"Umm... have you ever... you know... thought that........... we...lly Wonka was a spooky film, cus, shit the Umpa Lumpas , man\").\n\nIn the end, I finally told her that I was falling in love with her. She got really close to me, leaning. We were silent for a minute before I told her to look at me because I was going to kiss her. The short kiss I was going for wasn't what just happened.  \n\nSo now the issue is the speed we went, never really going out on a date but making out a lot. I became awkwardly speechless when I'm trying to tell her my feelings. To add, her parents are religiously against her dating (she try to get with this other guy last year but died short). We are keeping it a secret though it's becoming blatant that we're together. A fury of self lies and insecurities storm my mind. This seems so new to me.

She asked me to talk to my sister because she looks up to me and views me as a role model.\n\nMy younger sister was in her room, playing with her iPod touch. When my mother came in the room she was very clearly making an effort to keep the screen hidden from my mother, which naturally caused suspicion. When my mother asked her what she was doing, she pushed her phone under the bed. As my mother reached for the phone my sister started crying and kept apologizing. It turns out my sister was in a chat room called \"Sexy Bitches\" and was chatting with three people. My mother didn't mention what the conversation was, but I do not believe it was sexual in nature. She also mentioned that my sister had posted videos of herself on the internet. Again, I don't believe they were sexual in nature, however I'm still awaiting confirmation.\n\nI believe the reason my sister is behaving like this is because she does not feel loved or wanted. Our mother is emotionally, and frequently physically abusive. She has gotten better with age, with less physical abuse, but I know the damages that emotional abuse can cause. How can I talk about this with my sister and encourage her to be a mentally healthy young person so that she doesn't seek love and affection from potentially predatory individuals on the internet? Is it worth confronting my mother about the changes she needs to make to be a better parent?\n\nAdditionally, how can I help my divorced mother and father protect my sister from this? Are there parental controls my parents should consider? Inevitably she's going to have to use the internet again.\n\nI live thousands of miles away from my family and will be calling my sister tonight after work.

Earlier that day, there was a bit of an argument between flatmates, nothing huge about the level of cleanliness. I was basically the only one in the flat who thought that it could be cleaner. Anyway, by 5 pm, I was invited by my friend from home to play a lovely game of CSGO while talking on TS. All was well when he made a terrible mistake. Halfway through the game (we were on something called team speak which is basically Skype for gamers) and my friend says \"Will, listen to this\" what comes out of his arse is the most pitch perfect fart I've ever heard, it sounded straight out of a cartoon. Being the stupid boy I am, this was the funniest thing I'd heard for years.\n\nTime goes by and game ends. I say good bye to my friend and as I turn off our computer, I get a knock on my door. I open it to the sight of everyone I had this small argument with earlier and they invite me to discuss it. About half an hour later of petty teenage arguing, and I suddenly remember my friends fart. You know that situation everyone's been in where you laugh at the wrong time, well this was my moment. I soon start to feel my cheekbones rise as my friends fart keeps reminiscing my my brain, soon I'm giggling. The flat mates don't see the funny side and go off on one. They accuse me of not taking them seriously and all storm off. I'm now just sat here, the enemy of the flat due to my friends stupid fucking fart.\n\nTL;DR:",

Her mother recently was told by an unknown person that we have been having sex.  Her mother was not very upset, and helped her go through the process of getting birth control.  Her mother did not want to tell her father, because there was essentially no reason for him to know and it was unlikely he would react well.  Her father found out from her young siblings that she had gotten a prescription, connected the dots, and asked her mother directly.  Her mother told him the truth, insisting that she couldn't lie to him (despite the fact that she already was).  I came over the next day, not knowing that he had been told, and he essentially forced my girlfriend to make me leave the house.  Later that day my girlfriend informed me that I wasn't allowed to see her anymore until I sat down and had a \"man to man\" talk with her dad.  I refused and have continued to refuse because I think it is unfair of him to connect a punishment to the conversation and then try to act like it is on even ground.  I also do not want to concede to her parents in any way and show them that I can be forced to do what they want if they simply hurt our relationship.\n\nI have no respect for her father.  He refuses to work to support his family, lives off the good grace of his wealthy parents, and always chooses himself over my girlfriend (for instance he made her come back from her vacation 3 days early so she could babysit).  I work, go to school full time, and support myself completely.  While I understand a father wanting to have a candid conversation in this circumstance I fear that it is simply a power play.  I won't feign respect for the man.  My girlfriend has turned on me at this point (2 weeks after the punishment began) and I no longer know what to do.  Any advice would be really aprreciated.\n\nTL;DR:",

A guy that lives next to my parents does side work. He came over, gave me an estimate of $4k total ($2k for labor, $2k for materials), told me what to buy, said he could have the job done in three days. His wife/girlfriend came with him and my husband was home as well. \n\nI purchased all the materials and gave him $1k in cash up front, as agreed upon. The job was not complete in three days, and on Monday it rained and my roof leaked since there was only felt over it. He had PROMISED me that it wouldn't leak. He was there Tuesday and Wednesday to finish the job. Wednesday morning there was just clean up and a few odds and ends to take care of. I paid him the remainder of the cash,as he told me everything would be done by the time I got home from work.\n\nEverything was NOT done by the time I got home from work. My driveway wasn't cleaned (so I couldn't park in it), I had TV cable wires hanging off my house, pipes needed to be painted, shingles needed to be returned (I can't lift them) and the ceiling in my garage needed to be painted still. He told me he would be by several times and never showed. Finally this past weekend (two weeks later) he finished most of his work, except painting the ceiling and returning the shingles.\n\nIt's been two days and he's completely ignoring my calls and text messages. I have no idea what to do. Do I have any legal recourse? I have the bank records of withdrawing the cash as well as the receipts for the materials, but the actual \"contract\" was verbal.\n\nMy parents have told me that he has been home and my dad said he would go talk to him tomorrow for me. This is going on three weeks now and I have held up my end of the deal and paid him. I'm very frustrated - I shouldn't have paid him without everything being done.

My English teacher was a really good family friend and we have known him for probably around 20 years. He always comes to family parties we have and everything like that. I had his class on my schedule near the end of the school day, and because I really didn't put forth a lot of effort in my studies and had stayed up late the night before playing video games, i was really feeling a nap. We were watching a movie that day and the lights were off and it was the perfect time for a quick nap, so I took advantage. Now here's a little information on me when I sleep; I drool, a lot. I have no idea why I didn't think of that before going into a deep slumber in a classroom full of 30 students and a teacher that loved to play jokes. I woke up the the sounds of laughter and when I finally opened my eyes I see everyone looking and me and laughing. Being somewhat of a class clown I thought nothing of it. Until I turned around. RIGHT in my face there was my teacher, holding his cell phone and taking a picture of me looking like a zombie with a huge puddle of drool right underneath me. Fast forward two years later to graduation day, and low and behold I see on my slide in the senior slide show the picture he took of me sleeping with an ocean of drool underneath me. In front of hundreds of people. I've never been more embarrassed in my life.\n\nTL;DR:",

Quite short [5'2\"] and skinny (110lb) having taken after my parents. Main interests involve gaming, computers/technology and a bit of singing. Have not had any amount of dating beyond going to the movies with a girl in middle school, resulting in her distancing from me because she thought boys were icky.\n\nScenario; I work for a BBQ restaurant as a front store greeter/cashier and have worked there since the beginning of the year. A couple weeks ago, a female cashier gets hired (who I will be referring to as C for the purposes of the post) who I believe to be quite attractive, about my height and body shape.\n\nDue to the fact that she works the main registers and I work the front of the store, I don't get to interact with her besides the uncommon case of us both stocking at the same time.

This is only a rough estimate of her age, considering I haven't gotten the pleasure of talking with her much, but regardless I've heard of how long distance relationships tend to not do as well (assuming I can get something started between us).

I work in a casual dining restaurant, and the small size and high volume of patrons that the restaurant receives means that each staff member wears many hats, so to speak. So on a daily basis, I will not only be responsible for cooking food and making coffee, but also doing food prep and waiting tables. It can become pretty hectic at times, but we manage it very well!\n\nThis one particular night was quite a busy one, and we had a booking for some parents and about 5 or 6 children. Anyone who works in hospitality (or anyone who has met a child, really) can attest to the fact that children make a shitload of mess, let alone half a dozen of them. Tonight was no exception to that, as within 5 minutes of receiving their drink, one of the kids had spilled it everywhere. \n\nNoticing this, I immediately jumped into action and basically dropped everything I was currently doing to clean it up. Our floors are polished concrete, and I could just imagine a small child falling over and the parents blaming me for any injury their child might receive from fucking running around a restaurant and slipping over.\n\nI mopped it up, put a wet floor sign where I mopped, and said to the parents of the children \"watch out, these polished concrete floors become extremely slippery when wet, and I'd hate for your kids to slip and hurt themselves\". You can get where this is going by now, right?\n\nI go to clear another table not far away. I walk back over where I had just mopped, plates and glasses in hand. My feet slip, and I fall directly on my ass and break everything that I was carrying. Now red-faced after just warning everyone about the slippery floor, I quickly make a break for the kitchen to calm down and not see too many people laugh at my misfortune!\n\nTL;DR:",

I am just very reserved. My parents faced a traumatic marriage/divorce when I was very young and from then on, I was always quiet.  Also, English is not my first language so there's that weird factor. I have worked through my issues and I am healthier than ever emotionally and mentally. But due to the fact that I was always quiet, I think I lack conversation skills. I have very good days where I am outgoing and talking comes so naturally. But then I have days where I wake up and don't realize I haven't said a word until someone points it out. I am a thinker, listener, and an observer.\n\nI didn't know I had a problem with this. My family and people that have known me long enough all know that I am this way. For example: my mom and close friends come to me to talk about their troubles and get my sincere input/comfort. They wouldn't come to me to talk about the weather. I talk when I think is necessary..otherwise I feel like I am bothering people's thoughts or peace. My boyfriend tries to get me to talk...more or louder. It seems like he lovingly tries to bring me out of my own head. I seriously don't think I am as bad as he makes it sound. He's an amazing guy and I love him dearly. I am afraid maybe I make things awkward or weird for him by not talking as much as he would like. Perhaps I close off people from getting to know me better by not sharing my thoughts? I am trying to understand. It's not natural for me so I am oblivious. I am very interested in what people have to say and their thoughts, but I can't seem to voluntarily share my own.\n\nTL;DR:",

        "Write an excellent summary of the given text.\n\nTitle: TIFU by holding in a fart.\n\nText: This happened last week. I had a chocolate milk 2 go before a midterm in a lecture hall full of a few hundred people. Like an idiot I sit near the front, down the stairs far away from the exits around the upper levels.\n\nSo a few minutes into the midterm, I start to feel discomfort in my stomach. I think to myself shit, I really need to fart. A few minutes later it gets worse and now all I can concentrate on is holding in the gas in my intestines. I break into a sweat holding this gas in, contemplating to raising my hand to be escorted by a TA to the bathroom to fart. Having a TA accompany me to only hear me amplify my farts into the porcelain throne terrify me. I convinced myself I would just tough it out rather than go through that embarassing ordeal. I began concentrating on my multiple choice midterm when my stomach and intestine decided to make a loud lurching and bubbling noise as I held in the gas. It sounding like \"AROOOOOOOOOOOOOO DUG DUG DUG DUG DUG DUG\". The people all around me look up from their exams at me, I pretend not to notice. \n\nAt this point I begin frantically answering answers on my scantron as I feel the gas traveling to my ass. Then it happened again, this time with a vengeance and it lasted twice as long. I swear to god the at least 100 people have heard it this time. My face gets really hot and I start to panic then my nose starts to fucking bleed. Blood drops onto my scantron. The people beside me notice and the girl next to me breaks the silence and asks me If I am alright? I raise my hand and the professor comes over, while he is approaching me I clench again and the sound returns. \n\nWith my bloody hand covering my face, I tell the professor I am feeling extremely ill and need to be excused. He says its fine and to email him. \n\nI grab my things and left the class with everyone starting at me. BTW it wasn't gas. The silver lining is at least, I didn't shit myself. \n\nI emailed the prof, haven't heard back yet.\n\nTL;DR:",

My girlfriend is Polish and finds school fairly hard, so I was speaking with her dad about helping her, revising with her etc. \n\nHowever, he was fairly negative, saying the reason she was struggling with school was because she was lazy, stupid etc. This scaled into a bit of an argument, and I walked out.\n\nSince then, I haven't been able to see her even outside of her house, and her mum told me that he doesn't trust or like me.\n\nAnd more, her dad stops her from going to school during study leave (holiday during exams) to revise, because he thinks its so she can see me.

Am I wrong to want to fight it out?\n\nText: Girlfriend and I had been dating for close to 10 months. It started out as a fwb situation, but quickly became more than that. Recently, she had to take a new job and moved about an hour away. We talked very briefly before she left and decided that we didn't want anything to change and that we could continue seeing each other.\n\nCut to 2 months post-move: Things have been perfect between us, as always, but apparently the distance has gotten to her. She called and told me that the distance was getting hard for her, and maybe we should split up.\nI made the drive a few days later to talk about it, and it was clear to me as soon as I walked in that she had already made up her mind. She told me she didn't know how we could possibly fix the distance, and even though she never wanted to lose me, she had to.\n\nWe didn't take time to try anything new (skyping, more phone calls, letters, etc.) Discussing things with her, I mentioned that I would be open to moving closer to her soon. She said that she didn't know if she was ready for that (though she claims the only problem we have is that I'm not around enough.)\n\nI don't feel like the hour distance is something that can't be overcome, and I know that we could give it more of a shot. The fwb situation always put a strain on us; made it difficult for us to express ourselves clearly. But we love each other. That much is clear. I want to really try things with this girl, but she's adamant that even though she does as well, things can only possibly get worse from here instead of better.\n\nI suppose the real question here is, do you all feel like this is a valid enough reason for abuptly (and I mean, completely out of nowhere) ending a relationship? Or is there something else there that she's not telling me? I can't shake the feeling that things wouldn't have ended so suddenly had there not been something else in the mix.\n\nTL;DR:",

He's going to lose his job, car, money, and probably life from this incident. No girl is going to want to date him, no employer is going to want to hire him, and he's basically screwed. I always used to look up to him. I remember wanting to be just like him when I was younger. But now he's an alcoholic, and apparently a violent person who beats his wife... I never thought I'd ever hear those words in my entire god damn life. Have you ever lost respect for someone in one moment?\n\nTL;DR:",

Starving, I noticed that the only good thing left was a brand new can of reddiwhip. Not giving a shit, I took out the container, tilted my head back and pressed down the nozzle with my front/bottom teeth. I expected whipped cream, but what I got instead was a HUGE puff of nitrous oxide.. Within 30 seconds, I felt very fucked up and light-headed. The room was spinning and everything felt as if it were rapidly slowing down. My boss walks in the room to see my fumbling for a chair and witnesses me topple over onto the floor.

        "Write an excellent summary of the given text.\n\nTitle: Should I pursue getting back child support from my father? What would you do in my situation?\n\nText: Sorry this is kind of long... So I found out last month that the state is taking out thousands of dollars in back child support of my dad's refund check for his wife's two adult sons (23 and 26). I guess they just filed for it last year because this year is the first it's been taken out. I mentioned this to my grandmother and now she is all fired up wanting to file for my back child support ($21,000), however I'm having some reservations. I have a 5 year old little brother (I'm 23) and if it weren't for him I probably would not talk to or visit my father. My father and I never had the greatest relationship, but since my brother was born I've been working on that with him and we've actually made a lot of progress. I know that my dad and his wife have had nothing but financial problems since my brother was born. He's almost 50 and can't keep a job longer than a year or two, has nothing but bad luck with vehicles and they've lived in his mother's basement for 4 out of the past 5 years. My father also has a gambling problem which definitely doesn't help their financial situation. As nice as the extra money from the back child support would be, I feel that any money I would get would be taking away from my little brother. I'm in college but my husband makes a decent enough wage that we have a nice little savings and never have to worry about paying bills on time or having food in the fridge. I feel like any money I would get would just go sit in our savings account while they could actually be using it for food, clothes, bills, etc for my little brother. Also, I'm afraid it would put strain and tension on my rebuilt relationship with my father and I wouldn't be able to see my brother as much. I told my grandma I wouldn't go through with it, but she says my mom could still file for it without me. What should I do?\n\nTL;DR:",

After about a minute of her yelling and me trying to keep my composure she turns around and slams the door in my face and to this I lose it and say \"Bye bitch!\"\n\nShe turns around and is more fiery than ever and shes yelling cuss words and threatening me by \"someone bigger than me\".

Almost immediately after that relationship ended I was in a long distance relationship for a little under a year. She lived in my town but went to college in another town. She ended up breaking it off and went back to her ex. On top of all of this, I have a crush on a girl (I've told her how I felt, didn't work out for me.)\n\nTo add, I haven't talked to any of those exes but still talk to the crush here and there. \n\nAnyways, I started dating this girl on and off since last year and she's awesome, we have a lot of common interest, not too bad on the eyes but I feel like at times I can't/don't want to settle.\n\nAlso during the time we were \"off\" I had went out with someone else and that ended as well because of the same reason.\n\nSo what I'm asking is, what would be the best thing to do? I don't want to lead this girl on. I know she has stronger feelings for me than I do her and I think that maybe it is because I haven't fully moved from my crush (even with dashed hopes) or from my LTR. Maybe I am scared to commit in fear of missing out on someone who could be potentially a better match.\n\nI have talked to my friends about this but I don't think they fully understand what I'm going through.

Compared with men, women had higher scores for each item and a higher mean score (2.9 versus 2.1, P = .001), signifying greater belief in the potential of pregnancy to threaten careers. After adjusting for age, institution, postgraduate year, and knowledge of parental leave policies, women were less likely to plan to have children during residency (odds ratio 0.46 [95% confidence interval 0.25-0.84]).

First; some backstory:\n\nI dated this girl (we'll call her H) for four years (from grades 9-11, and then 2 years after we graduated high school, ending in october of 2011). The first time we broke up, it was me who broke up with H. Basically I felt too young to be in such a long relationship and I wasn't sure what I wanted. Unfortunately, it broke her heart and she never really got over it. It plagued our relationship when we finally did get back together, and eventually lead to her breaking up with me.\n\nOf course I was head over heels in love with her, and I was crushed for a long time. But I eventually got better, day by day as you know how it goes. almost a year after me and H broke up I started seeing another girl, C. We dated for about 3 months before I ended things with her.\n\nBasically, my reason for ending my relationship with C, while I did like her very much and we had great chemistry, I knew that if H ever called me (which I know would never happen, we haven't talked since the breakup and I'm pretty sure she's seeing someone else), I would go back to her without a second thought. I thought this wasn't fair to C, as she deserved someone who won't think of her as a silver medal, 2nd place.\n\nMy dilemma is, am I doing the right thing? I'm finding it hard to get close to people that I might want to have a relationship with because of my doubts. I'm certain that me and H will never get back together, but I'm still not completely over her.

Up until that point I'd had a pretty productive holiday weekend. I had a couple hours to kill before a family get-together so I decided to knock one more thing off my to-do list and change the oil in my 4Runner.  And so I did.  Or so I thought.  I guess I wasn't paying attention to which drain plug I removed because it turns out I drained the transmission fluid and I added 5.5 qts of oil to what turned out to be an already full oil reservoir.  *Then* I drove 3 miles to my parents' house for the shindig.  \n\nThe only good news in all of this was that my drive to my parents' house was via neighborhood streets so speeds never exceeded 35mph.  About halfway home from the get-together my dash lit up like a Christmas tree and that's when I realized I done goofed.\n\nSo I'm wondering how to proceed (clearly I need to drain the oil since it's way overfilled at this point).  Since I actually drove a few miles with in this condition, when I re-fill the transmission, should I change the filter (which involves removing part of the exhaust, removing the pan, replacing the pan gasket, etc) or should I be okay having only driven only 6 miles at 25-35mph?\n\nTL;DR:",

This is like a major TIFU and totally scarred my rep at work. \n\nThings started out fine as the party was beginning. I participated as a dancer for our account's contest and mind you, the venue for the party was at a high-end club in our city. After doing our dance, the party started. Drinks were flooding the club and I started moving over from table to table 'cause I was well acquainted with some of our account's workmates. I was receiving shots left and right and since we were at a club, it can't be helped that you have go to the dance floor and start partnering up with anybody on the floor. So yeah, I danced with almost anyone I encountered as long as I knew the person or barely acquainted with that him/her (Also our company has LGBT folks which are a bit rampant so yeah, mingling with almost anyone was the thing). \n\nHere come's my TIFU, I already started to get tons of shots from my buddies (Jaeger bombs and beer mixed up with some vodka just killed my system) and I'm tipsy, so I started dancing again and now it's with random people. Now I just realized that I was dancing with this tall dude who turned out to be gay and we danced all the way. Time passed we just sat their table near my friend's and talked. Suddenly the dude started to go for it and tried to kiss me and people from my floor saw it. Little did I know that dude was a supervisor from our floor. It was like the messiest thing I got myself into. Now people on my floor think I'm an easy to get drunkard with a weird taste for tall dudes even if I ain't gay. Fuuuuuu.

I've read reddit everyday and consider it a valuable source of information. I'll try to keep this short. \n\nI'm a PhD graduate student in chemical engineering (I have a BA in French and BS in ChemE) my research is in statistical thermodynamics. I grew up in a family that lives pay check to pay check; so I know and seen the value of a dollar. While I am grateful that I have a stipend for schooling (no tuition, loan forbearance, stipend) I would like to move out of my house. Since I'm living with my family I feel that I need to move on with my life (insert 23 yr old cliches here). I love my parents but I just need to do my own thing.\n\nSo! With my new contract I receive $23-27K a year which is bare minimum where I live. I've tried to move out with my friends but they are all unstable. I've recently looked into making my own micro home but its a lot of work pursuing a phd and my parents refuse to let me build it in my backyard.\n\nLong story short, I'm looking into buying a trailer (2003) for about $4500-5000 and living in a campground about 10 min from the university. I've looked into it and the camp charges $305 (including everything) year round. I'm an extreme introvert so I don't like the whole frat party scene; I just like my books. In fact, I seriously enjoy being alone. In addition, my internships during the summer may take me to cali or texas. Last summer I went to stanford uni to do research.\n\n So what do you guys think? Yay or nay?\n\nTL;DR:",

It all started in March before her birthday. Legal age here is 18 and her birthday was on March 23. I was planning with My sister a good 6 months before her birthday. The first red flag went up when he asked me why I would want to take her to a bar. He then started telling me why I shouldn't take her out, then he started saying that I wasn't going to be responsible for her and let her get taken home by some sleaze. He lost major points for questioning my responsibility. She then texted me a couple days later asking if i wanted to go out for dinner with her and her boufriend on her birthday, so the bar was out of the question and obviously he had manipulated her some way to change her mind. The next straw was when he typed on her wall \"FUCK YOU\" after they broke up for a second time. I suggested that if they were going to break up then to stay broken up. He then messaged me and swore at me, said some rude things that she had obviously mentioned. They ended up getting back together and are currently dating. He bought her a promise ring that looks like an engagement ring. She's a completely different person since she's been dating him and not in the good way. I can't stand to be around her for longer than 10 minutes, so I'm glad I don't live at home. I honestly have no idea what to do. I dont want this relationship to carry on because I'm  positive he's going to punch her one day and start beating on her. Also, I'm starting to dislike her as well. And she's blood. I know she won't listen to me but I want her to see that this is an unhealthy relationship and that there's a very good chance she'll lose me as a sister.\n\nTL;DR:",

During the summer her long term family friend [18M, James] asked to meet with her before he went on a gap year. She had a fling with this guy about 6 months before we started going out, but I thought it was fine as she was committed to me, and she had rejected him. \n\nHowever when they met up, he tried to make a move on her and told her he loved her (He did know she had a boyfriend). Luckily he went away shortly after and so the problem sort of did as well. Obviously I have been slightly paranoid ever since about him, feeling uncomfortable when he texts her etc.\n\nKnowing that he would be coming back I told her that I would feel very uncomfortable with her meeting up one on one and would be happy to meet him if he was truly over her. If i'm honest I may have come off as controlling but I never intended to come off as forbidding her to do anything.\n\nSo he came back in december and he started talking to her and asking to meet up and in front of me she said she wouldn't see him, then after New Years I find out from her friend that she bumped into them meeting up. Obviously I was upset and she claimed she planned on telling me and the only reason she didn't was because she thought I would flip out. We talked and she says that because he is a friend I'm overreacting, whilst I feel that because of their history he can't be seen as \"Just a friend\".\n\nSo, reddit, is my discomfort understandable, would you be happy if your bf/gf still wanted to see their ex who had feelings? Anyone who's been in my GF's position it would be very helpful.\n\nTL;DR:",

I have a separate bathroom, but the cat shits in my shower and the dogs piss all over the bathroom floor. What do I do?\n\nText: To be fair, we are all good friends. This isn't the typical \"I fucking hate my roommates\" cry for help. Although, laziness is definitely a factor. In the past, its taken over a week for one of them to take care of similar messes. I can deal with the living room and the kitchen cuz I'm barely ever here, but my bedroom and bathroom are not negotiable. I previously had a problem with the dogs in my room, but that ended when I threatened to piss on the corner of their bed if it happens to mine again. \n\nMine is the hallway bathroom, so it gets used by everyone. This also means that the bathroom door gets left open. As I said before, we DO in fact all get along, so doing something like putting a lock on my bathroom door wouldn't do much except maybe make me piss my pants one day when I can't find the key. \n\nThe female roommate says she will cut my dick off in my sleep if I take a shit in their shower, which in translation means it will probably spawn an argument or two.

Been together for almost a year now.\n\nShe is now at home with her parents for a few weeks vacation. The other night she told me that an ex coworker of hers was hitting on her hard and asked for sex, and asked again despite her telling him shes in a relationship now. This is a guy she had a fling with before we met by the way, she had told me about the fling long before this. \n\nI then promptly expressed to her that im not gonna be too comfortable with that guy around her like that, and asked if she still plans to hang out with him after what he said. She has no problems still hanging out with him still. So i then once again expressed my discomfort with her seeing this guy, and told her id really rather she didnt hang out with him. I told her he his card to be her friend the moment he hit on her and asked for sex.\n\nNow she thinks i dont have the right to tell her who she can and cant hangout with. Mind you all i said was i prefer she doesnt, id never tell her she cant because thatd be dumb. So now shes mad and \"dissapointed\" that i reacted this way when i told her i dont want her to chill with him after this, she basically said its controlling. I swear on my moms grave this is the FIRST time i ever told her anything about her friends or that i dont like her hanging out with somebody.\n\nAm i being controlling in this situation?

I couldn't lift any limb higher than an inch and couldn't stand up at all, so I call 111 (British non-emergency line) and they say 'Oh, we'll send an ambulance' - At this point I'm like 'Oh fuck...'. 5 Minutes later I am getting checked over by paramedics only to be told 'It might just be a cold, but we'll take you to the hospital just in case'.\nAfter a painful ride in an ambulance over speed bumps, I was skipping the endless line in A&E as they take me into resus (Generally where people who've had heart attacks etc go), so I question it more only to find out that within the next 10 minutes I was in the elevator going to the surgery room. It was at this point I thought I was fucked - I had no idea what it could be...

My main objective right now is to get at least 1 year of lab experience under my belt while studying for/taking the GRE. So far I haven't had much luck with getting callbacks - apart from really shitty, barely related positions.\n\nSo anyways, I interned with the MN Dept. of Agriculture last Summer, and my old supervisor just sent me an email asking if I'd be interested in doing QA/QC work for all the chemistry units in the lab building. She described the duties as follows:\n\n-maintaining control charts (spike recovery tests, etc)\n\n-calibrating equipment \n\n-keeping logs of lab maintainence, and fridge/freezer temps, etc\n\n-ordering chemicals, analytical standards, lab supplies\n\n-writing and reviewing SOPs\n\nSo considering that I am pursuing a career in micro/molecular biology, my question is - how would QA/QC chemistry work look on my resume, and would hiring supervisors consider it as relevant lab experience?\n\nThe reason I ask is because most lab positions I have seen ask for a certain amount of previous lab experience outside of the classroom. The QA/QC position would be in a laboratory setting, yet it wouldn't be related to the type of work that I would like to do.

Regular eye-tracking performance was evaluated in a third experiment.', 'At 150 msec, speed discrimination thresholds did not differ between schizophrenia patients (n = 38) and control subjects (n = 33). At 300 msec, patients had significantly higher thresholds than control subjects (p = .03). Furthermore, frequencies of eye tracking during the 300 msec stimulus were significantly correlated with speed discrimination in control subjects (p = .01) but not in patients, suggesting that eye-tracking initiation may benefit control subjects but not patients. The frequency of eye tracking during speed discrimination was not significantly related to regular eye-tracking performance.']",

He is considering this before other options of lowering the rent, or using other sources besides Craigslist.\n\nI am uncomfortable because we had a talk before he made this decision that this would make me uncomfortable, and he agreed he'd feel the same way if the roles were reversed.\n\nNow that he's feeling the pressure, he is having a woman look at the place tonight. I expressed how uncomfortable I am with this because they will have a shared space, and I do not live there... and he is still doing it, regardless of the promise he made me in the beginning and fully knowing how uncomfortable I am.\n\nHe even said that if I moved in with guys he would not be ok with this.

You can skip it if you want. The short answer is I met her daughter in high school and become friends with both of them at around 16 years old. Her daughter is the same age as me. When I got my license, I started taking Brooklyn, (the daughter) to school in the mornings and taking her home, it was on my way anyways. I started seeing them both more and more and this went on for a couple years. My friendship with Amber was just as casual as it was with her daughter.\n\nFast forward to about 8 months ago, Brooklyn decides to move to Las Vegas after high school for college and to live closer to her dad for awhile. At this point, I consider myself a closer friend to Amber than I did Brooklyn. We click on a more adult, more mature level than Brooklyn and I ever did. I still see Amber 2 or 3 times a week, because she still deals to me and I like seeing her. I know there is a huge difference in age, but she has mentioned being with guys as young as me in the past. \n\nAnother aspect of our relationship is we openly share sexual encounters, dates, boyfriends and girlfriends. I know a lot about what she likes. Sometimes it feels like she is hinting towards making some sort of move. My question is how do I go about \"making a move\" of my interest in her without freaking her out or making her uncomfortable around me? I'm pretty confident she is attracted to me, but I have never been with a woman as old as she is, so I really cannot read her as well. \n\nI'm looking for any advice that would help.

That is the last time I ever saw her.\n\nI leave that weekend for an adventure with my girlfriend, Jessica - I spend Friday, Saturday, with her, and come home later Sunday. Tons of pictures; we went to a couple of events, that sorta thing. On Sunday, I go over to my OTHER neighbor, Marie's place to hang out. I get to Marie's, and she is a screaming mimi! \"KATHY CAME OVER, AND SAID YOU STOLE HER MEDICATION AND SHE WAS DRUNK AND SCREAMING, YADDA YADDA!\" Whoa there turbo! Why would I steal her medication in the first place?! I have health insurance, and believe me, I don't need Prozac, LOL. A few weeks later, me and Marie have a falling out - due to unrelated matters. Marie is important, because when Kathy went over there, Marie was gonna call the cops she was so scared of Kathy. Mind you, I'm 25; Kathy is 40, and Marie is 65. These are grown ass women we're talking about, not college students.\n\nKathy texts me asking for $5 for beer, but I don't have $5, so I tell her no, explain that I was gone all weekend, and didn't have my phone, but in reality, I did, and I was ignoring her texts.\n\nSo, tonight, SIX WEEKS after all this shit goes down, Kathy texts both me and my other girlfriend, Melanie - just drunk, screaming, babbling that I stole her meds. I didn't steal them. She WON'T stop screaming at me. I blocked her before, but when she started texting, Melanie, I unblocked to see that she has been calling/texting without me answering - every couple of days. So, can I get a restraining order?\n\nTL;DR:",

Seeking advice to stay in school to graduate.\n\nText: Back in March, I came home to find the front of my apartment complex littered with police cars. It was no secret to me my roommates dealt (marijuana, LSD, and mushrooms), but we always had the agreement (even prior to my moving in) that if we ever were busted, each person would lay claim to their own stash. \n\nMy two roommates told the police all drugs in the house were theirs, but I'm still being charged 4 D felonies for possession and intent to sell. They promised to sign affidavits claiming I had no involvement in the situation, but after 6 months I haven't seen anything arise. Now I'm being told to bite the bullet.\n\nIf I go to jail over this, I lose all my funding for school (no help from parents; only loans, grants, and scholarships to stay afloat). I'm only a year out from entering graduate school, but this would ruin it all. Any drug felony prohibits any student from receiving any of these aid opportunities.\n\nTL;DR:",

I had been bedridden for about 3 or 4 days to be exact. Anyway, so as I lay in bed, I realized that I really had to go the bathroom. Here is where the TIFU comes in. So I walked to the bathroom and oddly I feel fine, for the moment. I go to the bathroom and begin taking a piss when all of a sudden I get a huge shot of dizziness. Just as I finished pissing, lucky enough, I completely lose balance and collapse into my bathtub, which is next to the toilet. As I was falling, I blacked out and soon opened my eyes to the floor of the bathtub as blood is pouring out of my nose into the bathtub. I dizzily stood up while blood just continued to come out of my nose. So, barely able to remain standing while blood is going all over the bathroom, I stumble to get a tissue and then went and collapsed on my bed, leaving my bathroom looking like a murder scene. I also gained a painful bruise on my forehead from where I must have hit my head on the way into the bathtub. RIP me.\n\nTL;DR:",

The state anxiety on the day before surgery decreased only in the intervention group (34.0 (8.4) versus 36.9 (10.7); P=0.001). The mean decrease in state score during the follow-up period was greater in the intervention group (P=0.001). No significant difference was found in the length of stay or readmission. Lower proportions of chest infection were found in the intervention group (10 (5.3) versus 1 (0.5); P=0.004).

The preoperative mean touch threshold value was 3.60 units. One week after the injection, the women experienced a decrease in the touch threshold value by 2.50 units. However, the sensation recovered gradually during the follow-up period (1.51 units at week 2, 2.39 units at week 4, 3.01 units at week 8, and 3.35 units at week 12). Significant differences were detected between multiple different measurement points (P<.05).

That experience produced many gems, here's two.\n\n1. We show up to an elderly man's apartment for his appointment to find him watching porn on the tv with mute on. He sat and stared at the tv without saying anything while we cleaned around him, and said nothing the entire time we were there.\n2. Another elderly story. We had an appointment to clean a nun's apartment. She was the sweetest old lady I've ever met, but she had difficulty moving around in her old age. While we were cleaning she disappeared for a while, but we didn't think much of it. We were about to leave we heard a faint noise coming from the bathroom. She was calling to us for help. The guy I was working with (who had been at the company for 5+ years) got out of there and left me to handle it because I was the new guy. I turned away as I opened the door to ask what was wrong. Turns out she was stuck on the toilet and needed me to help her up. I grabbed both of her hands to help her up, then one at a time while she pulled up her underwear. She said \"thanks sweetie\" and that was that.\n\n(\n\nTL;DR:",

Roommate is currently in a on-again off-again relationship with one of their classmates.\n\nHe swears he has only called me her name 3 times (he doesn't always realize when it has happened, it's more in the 5-7 range) but also states he sometimes calls her my name.  Admittedly I am sensitive about the issue as I have been cheated on in every relationship I have been in. Compounding the insecurity is that he has expressed his interest in high heels, hoop earrings, edgy makeup, and feminine clothing.  I'm a more outdoorsy girl who has a tendency to create my own unconventional makeup techniques and am unable to wear tall high heels after I broke my ankle in a climbing accident. My nails are always a mess and my hair is unruly. And I'm short.

Oh, what I would do for her hair.\n\nI can't even begin to count the number of times my boyfriend has made a comment on my nails (\"We should really paint your nails\" so. sick. of it.), asked me to wear heels, or stated that he really wants to me go back to my natural hair color and original length.  At the same time though he always states I'm super sexy and that I could wear anything/have any hair style and he'd still find me super sexy. Seriously, whenever we spend time together he tells me I'm beautiful at a minimum 4 times. Talk about confusing signals.\n\nHe states that he has no feelings for his roommate and says that she is not attractive to him for a multitude of reasons, but only ended up stating her weight (she is overweight but in my opinion she carries it well). Whenever he calls me her name though it is like a dagger to the heart. So am I being overly sensitive or is there an underlying emotional attachment going on?\n\nTL;DR:",

He is by far the best boyfriend i have ever had and I really see us heading towards marriage and kids.\n\nBefore I met him, he was seeing a girl. He told me that they kept it casual (fwb, fuck buddies whatever you want to call it) because she was moving away and he didn't feel it was worth doing long distance for. I never got the impression that she was \"the one who got away\", just that he enjoyed the sex and that she really enjoyed anal, something he is obsessed with and that I'm only new to.\n\nRecently though, its become apparent that they are still in quite close contact. He doesn't seem to realise that I know who she is, and whenever she pops up on facebook he refers to her as a \"friend\". He also never opens their conversation or tells me what they are speaking about (which he does with everyone else). This makes me think they are having inappropriate conversations, or something flirty. She's also sent him a post card which made me very angry.\nShe knows he has a girlfriend, and she's in a different country, so I don't really feel like she is a threat. But I'll admit, I have been very tempted to snoop (we have eachothers passwords) but so far haven't.\n\nA part of me likes that he thinks he is getting away with this, and is only flirting with someone he can't actually see in person. But it also makes me quite angry and at times has made me feel pretty awful during sex. For example if I refuse anal because it feels to sore, then at the back of my mind I am wondering if he wishes he was with her instead.\nSo should I confront him or turn a blind eye?\n\nTL;DR:",

He doesnt want to talk about anything or do anything together when we hang out. Just sit quietly while he watches videos on youtube or browses reddit or something. If i try to get him to come do something with me, or suggest something he tells me he doesnt feel like it everytime. I discussed this whole situation with him this morning, asking him if Ive done something and why hes been so distant lately and he told me \"Its just how he gets sometimes\", but we've been together for a year and ive NEVER seen him act like this before.

I didn't know her back then but we've had many conversations about it and I know how devastating it was and still occasionally is for her. Her mother had a parent die from cancer and they've lost multiple family members to it.\n\nShe has always found comfort in her pets in tough times and I always try to be there for her for whatever she needs.\n\nRecently one of her two dogs has gotten extremely sick, he stopped eating and has been very tired and struggled getting around the house.

A little over 3 months ago I started receiving facebook messages from her. This girl was in one of my classes in 2006, and I interacted with her maybe 2 or 3 times, in reference to homework or something. Nothing significant at all. The messages she sent me on facebook were mostly one sentence, just about music she liked or asking me why I wasn't responding. After being annoyed with all the messages I just decided to block her, and thought nothing of it. Then within a day I started receiving messages from her on my Youtube account, which I also ignored. Eventually she went away. Now again, a few days ago, she sent me around 20 more messages on Youtube, and somehow found my email address. Messages just started pouring in. In this round, the Youtube messages were all weird Christian shit. Bible verses, Christian cultists speaking, etc.\n\nHere's the fucked up part. She started messaging people I know. My friends, my sister, and my girlfriend, and recalling intimate details about our lives; tattoos some of my friends have, relationships, people's backgrounds, places people have lived. She sent them anywhere between 10-30 messages each. I asked most of my friends to block her if they hadn't already. No one knows her at all, and some even thought she was a sort of spam bot. No one has replied to her to my knowledge, but I don't know how many of my friends/acquaintances she has contacted.\n\nThough none of the messages are threatening, it's getting to be a bit scary. I'm not sure what I should do. I'm concerned she will begin to contact people I work with in the professional world, or potentially do some damage. Please, any advice would be great.\n\nTL;DR:",

However, the clinical difficulty in using this approach lies in determining which type II SCHFs can be managed successfully without a surgical intervention.', 'We reviewed clinical and radiographic information on 259 pediatric type II SCHFs that were enrolled in a prospective registry of elbow fractures. The characteristics of the patients who were treated without surgery were compared with those of patients who were treated surgically. Treatment outcomes, as assessed by the final clinical and radiographic alignment, range of motion of the elbow, and complications, were compared between the groups to define clinical and radiographic features that related to success or failure of nonoperative management.', 'During the course of treatment, 39 fractures were found to have unsatisfactory alignment with nonoperative management and were taken for surgery. Ultimately, 150 fractures (57.9%) were treated nonoperatively, and 109 fractures (42.1%) were treated surgically. At final follow-up, outcome measures of change in carrying angle, range of motion, and complications did not show clinically significant differences between treatment groups. Fractures without rotational deformity or coronal angulation and with a shaft-condylar angle of>15 degrees were more likely to be associated with successful nonsurgical treatment.

I asked for oral/finger sex and he said no...It didn't give him fulfillment because of his depression so he doesn't do it.\n\nAt that point, I think I must've over reacted a bit...I basically changed into my pajamas and crawled into his bed and quietly wept myself to sleep, in the dark.

The server called out my order and I picked it up, refilled my drink and walked out. Remember the half cup's worth of Dr. Pepper? Well all that carbonation was coming up for a huge burp. I was getting ready to let it out, when for some reason I thought it would be really amusing to do my best black metal band impersonation and say \"Praise Satan\" while having a loud nasty burp. As soon as i finished my praising of our dark lord and savior I kinda grinned to myself for a job well done and noticed a happy little family staring at me with looks  of disbelief and the wife clutching a rosary to her chest. I live in a predominantly Hispanic and Catholic area so I was not surprised, but still. I felt like a dick.\n\nTL;DR:",

He gave her black eyes the last time she went to Italy and the last time he was in the US. She recently broke up with him. Now, he won't stop calling her new job and booked a ticked to the US. He's told her that he won't stop calling her at work until she pays him back for the ticket he bought (after she told him it was over no less). They have been together for a year, but the abuse is escalating. I am worried about her safety, my sister's and mine if he comes back to the US.\n\nShe won't tell anyone at work what's going on, because she's afraid they'll fire her. I think it's more likely that she'll be fired if she doesn't tell them. She tried to cut contact, but he calls her non-stop. I think that when she calls him back, she tells him that constant calling will work. I want to throw her phone out the window whenever I hear them talking. \n\nWhat should I do? What can I do?

Of course, I want to be supportive, but I don't want it to seem - at all - as if I approve of the relationship, him, his behavior or even of her behavior.

I wanna know if he would still be friends with me if I were single and would still never date him.

Broke up and restarted many times. It was very fulfilling.\n\nThen after 2 months, of NC at all. She texts me with a picture of us. She then says good times, hope everything is well.\n\nOFC I bite. Asking her how she's doing. She just feels the need to tell me she has a bf now.\n\nImmediately I reply that I've had about 13 girlfriends (obviously one night standers and a higher number), and she freaks out about how unattractive and nasty that is.\n\nThen she says she doesn't want to fight. We did, a little.\n\nI can't understand why she would do this. A lot of people are telling me she's trying to make me feel bad. But like why am I even on her mind? If she really moved on and his happy with someone new, why waste her time trying to hurt me.\n\nI ended up the text day texting her that yes I am having fun because it's going to take me longer to have the strength she does to be in a relationship. I also told her that I do still have feelings and I'm trying to let them expire. 2 months just isn't that long, yknow?\n\nI made my points, but I can't get over how bad this is setting me in my recovery, I was just about completely over her.

        "Write an excellent summary of the given text.\n\nTitle: My [22M] struggle with two exes [20F and 25F]\n\nText: The problems started when I broke up with my girlfriend of 3 years [20F] in November 2012. Let's call her Sarah. That was one of the toughest experiences in my life. \n\nI could have sworn that she was the woman of my life. We were happy; both of us, without an exception. There was not a single sign of any relationship struggle. In November, she went on a archaeologic excursion with her universe. The first few days of her spending there were okay. \n\nThen the contacting gradually lowered and lowered. About a week in she lets me know that she doesn't think the relationship can work; she doesn't miss me anymore and doesn't love me anymore. It was a huge blow to me. I fell on the complete bottom and never mangaged to recuperate. Ever since then, there's been this clinging emptyness inside me.\n\nAbout 3 months ago, I met a woman online. Let's call her Rachel. We talked a lot and eventually decided to try an online relationship. It worked for two months, where it fell apart. I didn't feel the same as I did in the previous relationship. It did hurt a bit, but not as much. \n\nWe decided to stay friends, because we enjoyed eachother's company. Another important part to mention is that we felt incredible sexual attraction towards eachother. So let's say that we continued being friends - with benefits. It was working great. We talked, had fun, spent time together. Then today, she told me out of nowhere that she found a new boyfriend. \n\nAnd today, that clinging emptyness came back.  \n\nI am completely mortified with no sense of direction. What am I to do? How can I distract myself? It's almost 6am and sleep has never been so far away. I keep on thinking about it. What would be the most rational thing of me to do? Cut all contact? Try and be her friend and feel this way? How can I get rid of this empty feeling?\n\nAny help and insight would be appreciated.\n\nTL;DR:",

New to Reddit and I'm typing this on mobile but here I go\nMe and my girlfriend have been together for almost 2 years and we've had our ups and downs but we love eachother and want a future together.\nI met my girllfriend online while I was going to school to become a veterimary assistant and I'm currently back home working to pay off my student loans so I can move back and get an appartment and a job that I actually want and went to school for. My girlfriend lives a 7 hour bus ride away from me so we only get to see eachother every few months and its been like that for almost a year now and it sucks but its mostly my fault.\n\nWhat happens is, we usually have date nights; nights where we do things together like watch movies, Skype, play games, bone, all that wonderfull stuff. Those arent happening very often because I want them to be perfect.\nLets say I get off work at 5, loads of time for me to get supper and watch a movie and make love to my wonderful girlfriend before one of us has to be in bed to get up for school in her case or work in mine, but in my head thats not enough time. For whatever reason no amount of time is enough and I keep putting off date nights until I think it'll be perfect but it never is so it ends up being days without sex, weeks without Skype or movies and its not fair to her at all.\nI know shes getting frustrated with me and that only makes me want our time together more perfect which makes me dig my hole further down. The best thing to walk into my life deserves perfection but its my idea of perfection thats killing this relationship. I need help and I dont know where to turn. I have no friends and my family isnt a big fan of me dating another girl in the first place so I'm totally lost. Any advice would be helpful\n\nTL;DR:",

We're planning on spending the summer together in his hometown (he never got to have a \"last summer at home\" for various reasons). He lives in a small town, but there is a city nearby. Here's the thing: he's helping to direct a musical that's taking place in his hometown that summer, in addition to working at a day care type program through the high school, and he's playing the piano for his church as well. I'm hoping to have a job, but that's really about it. I don't know a lot of people in his hometown, and the people I do know I know through him. I'm the type of person that hates not having something to do, and I'm worried that I'm going to spend most of the summer sitting around at home waiting for him to get back because he's going to be so busy and I'm really not going to be. So I'm asking: how can I avoid becoming a housewife in this relationship? He already knows that I feel like shit about myself because he does so much stuff and I don't do a whole lot, but the problem is, I just don't know what there is to do, especially in a town I'm not exactly familiar with.

She said along the same lines as I did, but she said she's \"not really looking for a relationship right now\" and I didn't really think anything of it because at the time I wasn't either and hadn't even hinted at it so I didn't really think anything of it. \n\nI ended up telling her that I had food that I was going to cook for my ex one last time (I wanted to go out on a good note) but she, instead, said horrendous things to me.

        "Write an excellent summary of the given text.\n\nTitle: Parents of reddit, friend's mom asked me for help and I don't know what to do.\n\nText: My roommate and best friend for about 8 years is having some issues. She lost her job recently and has been more or less directionless since then. She has a horrible skin condition on her face that she obsesses over and sometimes won't leave the house because she feels it is too disgusting. (Not going to lie, it looks pretty bad, but it is definitely worse if she stays in and picks at it all day.) She also just lost her cat of 17 years which hit her pretty hard. Aside from that, she's pretty normal, has a decent sense of humor about everything and has a boyfriend, no drug dependency that I'm aware of.\n\nSo this is where you come in parents... her mom called me this morning in hysterics saying that she is really worried about her daughter and wants to get her hospitalized. She wants my help in saving her child and will do anything to get her help. Of course this came as a shock to me, because although she has the problems I listed above, I never thought she needed any kind of intervention or hospitalization. Her mom thinks that the skin condition and lack of direction is a result of a prescription drug problem, which I have no evidence of. My question is how do I talk her mom off the ledge from doing something drastic. Or should I not because maybe I'm underestimating the problem as much as I think her mom is overestimating it?  My thought was to call her mom back and just answer any questions she might have so she isn't so in the dark. I can agree with her mom that she isn't 100% herself and have some thoughts on how to help her on my own... but my real question is about helping her mom. \n\nHave you ever been worried about your children like this? How did it play out? \nWhat is her mom hoping that I will do to help?\nShould I suggest that the hospitalization might backfire, or should I stay out of it in case there is a real need for it that I just don't see.\nI know my friend won't like that I'm talking with her mom about her, but I just want to do whats right and I worry that her mom's hysterics may need attention too. \nSomeone help!!!\n\nTL;DR:",

We both met on a camping trip through work. We got along really well, and after a long day of hiking, he ended up sharing his pillow with me (mine had been soaked with redbull on the drive up). Anyways, after the camping trip he asked a mutual friend for my number. We started talking and got rather flirty with one another. The only problem was that I had a boyfriend at the time. Of course I knew this was not the right thing to be doing while in a relationship, but I was really starting to like this guy and we had become really great friends.\n\nFast forward a few months, I am single. And of course still crazy about my camping guy. We were already hanging out a lot, so it was only a matter of time before we actually started becoming a thing. So in January, on my birthday, we kissed for the first time. And pretty much since then we have been together. We see each other at least once a week (we are both busy with school and work), and have had sex numerous times. We also go out to eat, see movies, and just relax with one another. Pretty much what you would do in a normal dating relationship, right? He is an awesome guy and I always enjoy the time we spend together. And to be honest, I am falling crazy hard for him. \n\nThe only problem with our relationship is that we have never actually sat down and had the conversation as to what we are and what we are doing. Now I know I should be having this conversation with him, but frankly I am afraid to approach the topic and mess up what we have been doing since January. \n\nAlso, beyond not defining our relationship, I have not met any of his family, and have not met any of his friends (except for his roommate, and a brief encounter with another one of his friends). Is this normal, per se? If it helps, he is Asian (don't know if it's a cultural thing?) He has met a few of my friends and my brother, but this is only because we all work together. \n\nAnyways, any advice/suggestions?\n\nTL;DR:",

So I snuck on his phone, and found him looking at porn. He did this while at work, when I worked with him. After he denied wanting sex that morning. We had a no porn rule for 2 years, so I confronted him and we got in a fight. I caved and told him come to me if he wanted sex, but if I wasn't in the mood don't hide it. \n\nA while later, I check his history again and find Chaturbate in his search history. He looked at 5 or so women, and I wanted to puke. I had never heard of this place, but I knew what one of those pay-to-strip places looked like. I got pissed, and yet again we fought. I told him if he must look at porn, look at porn! Don't talk to naked women!\n\nNow my BF is trying to be a YouTube and Twitch star.

My best friend, for privacy let's call her Aly, and I were pretty close. We talked everyday, texted, went out with friends etc. Well all that was about to change. My parents knew hers so if they had to go somewhere and I was bored at home I'd go over to her house since we lived fairly close. One day my parents had a christmas party to attend and I was sitting at home being bored as hell so I decided to give Aly a visit and thought we would watch a movie or something. I got to her house and as usual I was welcomed inside. We decided to go to the basement where there was a projection screen for movies. Coincidentally her parents had something to attend as well so they left about half an hour of me arriving. Now this movie we were watching wasn't exactly clean and so there were sexual references within it. There was this one specific scene which I have to admit turned me on a little. Apparently it effected my friend a little too much and she suddenly came in close. During the heat of the moment I went in as well and it lasted about 5-7 seconds. When we came apart she looked to me and I saw she wanted more. I freaked out and jumped back saying I had to go, almost slipping on the carpet. I went home and thought about what just happened. Maybe I overreacted a little too much, maybe not? She definitely thought so. After that I didn't really go to her house or talk or text her. Thinking back, I still don't know what I should have done but I surely fucked up.\n\nTL;DR:",

How can I fix this?\n\nText: Quick background: I have been graduated from college for two years with a degree in finance and accounting. I currently work at a local restaurant as a server. About 3 months ago I left a restaurant that I had worked at for 5 years to work at this current restaurant with more reasonable hours. The move to this restaurant is supposed to be temporary while I search for something in accounting or finance. \n\nFast forward to this morning.  I am interviewing for a position as an auditor with a small firm. The interview is going great. He asks some technical questions and the standard, \"Tell me about a time when...\" type of questions. \n\nThen we start going over my resume. As he is going through it I realize that I had given him an out of date version of the resume which does not have my current employer listed. It still says that I am employed with the previous restaurant that I left about 3 months ago.  I kind of panicked and wasn't sure if I should point out the mistake or not. I was worried about stopping the momentum of the interview/pointing out a glaring mistake on a resume that should be pristine.  In the end I decided to just let it ride and answered questions about the job as if I were still employed there. In my panicked state I figured the two jobs are essentially interchangeable and I've only been at the current place for 3 months so not listing a temporary position on the resume is no big deal. \n\nSo the interview finishes up and I am immediately asked to come back in again to meet the other partners and staff members. It went well. Really well. I can just tell that I have a really good shot at this. Pretty damn excited. \n\nBut now I'm realizing that he will most likely try to verify my employment with the restaurant that I am no longer working for. How can I avoid this from looking like I just lied to him? I feel like I should contact him and explain the mistake but I don't want to look inept or worse shady for not saying anything during the interview. How can I fix this?\n\nTL;DR:",

Due to this and some other stuff, my mom has decided to get me counseling... my dad argued with her about that a bit, my parents got me involved in their petty arguments for the billionth time, I tried to get out of it unsuccessfully... but that's not what this is about.\n\nMy mom agreed to spend 2 days after I wrote the letter with just us, and Anna's in our house a little less. I know, that's not quite what I wanted. She doesn't really spend time with just us doing anything fun anymore. In that aspect, I've kinda given up. \n\nNot much I can do after my ultimate expression of desire to be with her more often is pushed aside. She acknowledged it for about a week and then it went away to her. Yeah, I'm emotional about it, but what can I do anymore? Also, my mom seems more irritable lately. I'd rather tread on that eggshell carefully.\n\nSo... happy-ish ending, I suppose? It's not the biggest stressor in my life anymore. But I'm not satisfied with how my mom is handling things. Living with dad, by the way, would be a nightmare. For many reasons- I love him and all, but so many things just wouldn't work.\n\nThanks again reddit.",

The girl I am seeing goes to another college about 2 hours away. She has a lot of guy friends, including her best friend, which I am ok with. We'll call him J. What bothers me is two things. 1.) She used to date J for a brief period of time, until he started see other girls, she wanted something exclusive, so they broke up. They remained close friends 3 years since. 2.) She idolizes him. She talks about how he is the ideal romantic parter (save for the unfaithfulness). She told me this before we were in a relationship. \n\nShe called me up last night, the conversation lasted about a minute, and then she abruptly told me she had to leave. I found out later that J had shown up while she was talking to me and she decided it would be rude to have him wait while she was on the phone (I kind of get that, but some sort of explanation would have been nice). It made me feel pretty shitty. She called back a few hours later and talked about she hadn't had so much fun hanging out with him in a long time, how they made each other laugh the whole night. I felt shittier. \n\nHere is my dilemma. I don't think they are doing anything romantic together, per se, but I think that she is settling for me. I fear that she thinks he would be perfect if he were only more interested in a serious relationship. Should I ask her if this is true? How should I bring this up to her?

We went long distance for college and two years ago, my boyfriend and I ended the LD by moving in together in City B. As we were looking into apartments my sister asked if we would get a 2BR and let her live with us because she wanted to leave City A. We agreed. About six months later my boyfriend moved back to City A for financial and education reasons and my sister and I continued living together. \n\nOur renewed lease ends in June. I am graduating in December and moving back to City A. My sister wants to move in with her boyfriend. I asked if they could do what I did for her - rent a 2 bedroom and let me stay with them. She turned me down. After discussing options with my sister, we agreed to move apart. I would live in student housing for the last semester (about 3x as expensive as splitting an apartment with then) and she would move in with her boyfriend. She agreed I could live with them in the gap in between our lease ending and my new one starting which is 1.5 months.\n\nI am visiting City A this weekend and yesterday she texted me to let me know she no longer will let me live with them in the gap. Not really sure what I will do now. I'm not working atm and I don't have classes this summer so I am considering living with my boyfriend (in his parents house) the entire summer. That way I could get a job in City A for the whole summer instead of going back and forth. \n\nIf I do this, I don't want to pay rent for the 2 months I will be staying with my boyfriend. I'm sure legally I am obligated but she has effectively blocked me from being able to live there. Emotionally I don't want to pay, that is. Is there any way I could approach this with her? What could she do if I just didn't pay? I am pretty done with her at this point so I don't care about the emotional fallout.\n\nAm I unreasonable for being mad?\n\nTL;DR:",

        "Throwaway account for obvious reasons.  So a while ago my mother and sister committed credit card fraud and took out several cards in my name and never made payments on them.  I was attending college and not living at home.  I had absolutely no idea this was going on until about a year ago, and they were very good at throwing away any mail I got about the issue.  And not actually having a credit card myself, I was unaware of the consequences of this.  I couldn't exactly turn them in since they are family, and much of the money spent on the cards went to paying our house's mortgage.\n\nWell two days ago I went to buy dinner to find out my bank account was empty.  Apparently one of the suits against me went through, and they took all $2190 in my bank account.  I literally having nothing.  I can't afford gas to drive to work, I can't afford food.  I have no money what-so-ever.  I called my bank and found out the total amount awarded to the debt agency was $2500, so they will certainly be taking more in the future.  At this point I immediately canceled my direct deposit.  But now I have no idea what to do.  I know all the debt has been bought by various collection agencies.  I have no idea who owns what debt, how many suits are against me, or even how much all of it is (Though I have a rough estimate that it is over $10,000).  I don't want to live my life afraid to deposit money in my bank account for fear that it will just be taken from me.  At this point I have no choice but to pay for what they did, but I have no idea who to pay.  And at this point I'm afraid its too late to negotiate with anyone.  There has to be a better option than living like a hobo without a bank account and hiding my money under my mattress.  So how to I even begin to put back together my life after this?",

Every day he'd make a point of checking up on us, making sure we were on our best behaviour and generally slandering us when talking to other teachers. Fair enough, I thought, but it should have stopped at some point.\nIt didn't - he kept it up for months after the event.\n\nOne day we decided enough was enough, and it was time for some petty revenge. It was a Monday, and our first lesson was practical science. Today's lesson involved experimenting with how different materials combusted, and as such there were quite a lot of different chemicals and powders around. The more sticky-fingered friend of ours spied a vial of some interesting-looking green powder, and pocketed it for later use.\n\nNext up was cooking class, and today we were making muffins. This is about the time our plan came into effect - we would spike one or two of the muffins with this green powder (it didn't have warning labels on it - we didn't want to kill the guy!) and then serve them to him later. And so we did. We snuck some powder into the muffins, baked them, and then made sure to separate the spiked muffins from the rest.\n\nThe third friend - the nicest of us, and most well-mannered - went alone to present the muffins to the principal, who oddly enough accepted them without much fuss, but no \"thank-you\". Not that we cared, he was about to get a nasty surprise.\n\nFor the rest of the week he came into school a bit more agitated than usual, but otherwise left us more or less alone for a change. Eventually curiosity got the better of us, and we went on the internet to look up the effects of the powder we'd spiked the muffins with...\n\nTurns out the powder causes temporary erectile dysfunction and itchiness.\n\nTL;DR:",

By the time I get dressed and do my typical bathroom duties, I am attacked by an episode of nausea or cramps before I can even eat breakfast. For a while I just let it go because I was in high school and wasn't worried about missing days because I wasn't feeling well. But now that I am in college it has really been having a negative affect on me and my attendance, as well as getting my weld projects and duct fittings done before the end of the year. I really can't afford to be missing any more days of school because of this, but I also can't afford to be getting nauseated and dizzy in a metals fabrication shop, otherwise nausea will be the least of my physical problems.\n\nI do take a couple medications for anxiety, I just got off 10 mg lexapro after being on a 20 mg regime for roughly a year. Now I am taking buspirone 5 mg 3 times a day. As you could probably guess, my first dose is in the morning and I try my best not to forget to take it because of nausea since my panic/anxiety attacks are quite prevalent in the morning hours. I also take 10 mg propranolol episodically for tremors, which might be contributing to my dizziness since I miss breakfast so often. Just about everyday I skip breakfast because almost immediately upon waking up I am bombarded with nausea. It usually subsides around 3pm regardless of whether or not I ate lunch. \n\nThese symptoms are really starting to mess with my college curriculum. Missing Gen. Ed. classes is one thing, but missing valuable shop time because I always feel the need to vomit and nothing comes up is a whole another deal.\n\nTL;DR:",

We are basically a couple, but without the title. With finals over we are long-ish distance, about an hour apart, and both work, so I see him about once a week or so and we usually sleepover at each other's places.\n\nAnyways, when I asked him about relationships, he said he wanted to get his depression/panic disorder under control, which I understand. But it's been 6 months and he hasn't made much effort. I told him he should try to get medication since his other one have him awful side effects, but he hasn't done so yet, although he said he wants to get better for me and he'll do it so we can be happy.  I'm transferring schools and am worried even when the summer ends he won't be ready, and we'd have been seeing each other 10 months by that time. \n\nHe has also made comments saying how when he gets in a relationship it's for the long run (years or until marriage). He says he wants to give me something as good as he can when he gets better and that's why he wants to wait for a relationship, and that not being in a relationship means Hea not dragging me down and would let me leave if I want. I can tell he loves me. He tells me all the time and treats me amazing when we are together, but I don't feel 100% comfortable with the situation. I know he has depression, but even during the school year he was always out for hours on end with friends and having a good time.\n\nI guess I'd just like to know what someone would do in this situation. I love him and want to be there for him, but I don't know how long I can wait, especially if I'm leaving (but not far away). Should I wait through the summer and see how things go or if they will change? The last time I had a relationship conversation was a month or so ago anyways.\n\nTL;DR:",

It seemed like pretty obvious hints.\n\nI caught her right as we were walking out the door, and we just talked about the day and whatever, as we walked to our bus. I asked her if she was doing anything over the weekend, she said she was busy with swim and something else, but nothing other then that.

We've been texting for a few weeks so it's not like it's out of the blue.\n\nReddit, not sure what I should do here. Should I text her again? maybe she just didn't get it.

It's helped with working through a bunch of issues and your stories are inspiring. 24F 5'4\" SW 148 GW 125 CW 135\n\nI got down to 127.6 a few weeks ago and was so excited and proud, riding this incredible high that I was so close to my GW. Then my boyfriend and I split, I was devastated and parts of me still are. To cope I've been traveling a lot, which leads to this YOLO mentality of trying everything in sight. Friends have been coming to visit which means brunch or drinking which leads to cheesy fries and crying in bed with a pan of brownies. I digress. Last night I went on a first date, it was fine.. I spent the entire drive home crying because I was so upset to be going through this (pointless IMO) break up and that I'd let myself gain the weight back so quickly. I'm lucky to still be exercising and eating decently during the week, but I now see how much those weekend calories destroy week work. \n\nAfter a ton of journaling (so therapeutic) and a ton of sleep, I woke up this morning with the thought \"I can't change my circumstances, but I can change my choices and challenges.\" No, this isn't revolutionary, and this thought is basically the premise of R/loseit. However it was exactly what I needed to help jumpstart myself into gear again. It's so easy to blame circumstance and things we can't control on bad outcomes. It's hard to man up and choose to take the high road, to not order the cheese fries with the mentality that I'll do better tomorrow. It's hard to choose your health and your self every single day, but it's my choice to do so. I choose to love myself and stop hurting my future me. I choose to not let my circumstances get in my way. To let this be a better-ment challenge and choose to use my energy for continued positive change. \n\nSorry if this doesn't make sense. I'm half asleep but hoping it'll help someone.\n\nTL;DR:",

        "Omelettes make a great breakfast, and I enjoy making them because they are very easy to cook. First, I get the eggs out and begin cracking them on the side of the bowl and dumping them into the bowl. I normally use two eggs whites and one whole egg to cut the calories. I begin beating the eggs with a fork or a whisk. I add some salt and pepper to the mix for flavor. I pour the mixture into the hot frying pan. I make sure that I add some vegetable oil to the pan before I add the eggs though because I don't want them to stick. I let the pan sit for a bit so the egg mixture heats up a bit on one side. As this occurs, I add some cheese or vegetable to the center of the egg mixture. Really, almost any type of cheese or vegetable makes a good omelette. I then flip one side of the omelette over on to itself to seal in the contents in the middle. I then flip the omelette over several more times to lightly brown it on both sides. It is then ready to serve!",

Last week I was rear-ended in my one year old Honda Civic while waiting to turn right at an intersection. Damage wasn't horrible but there is an imprint of this lady's license plate on the rear bumper, including two punctures from the screws that hold the plate on. She begged me not to go through insurance and to just take cash. We exchanged information and I went to the police station, but the police person said it was not reportable.\n\nI went to two places to get quotes for fixing the bumper. One was $960 and the other was $660. I called the lady who hit me and told her the $660 price. She freaked out and said she never expected me to even call her. She passed me off to her brother and I never spoke to her again.\n\nI want to get my car fixed because it is so new, and I want to go to the $660 place because I liked them and they seemed reasonable. Also it's walkable from my place so I don't need to rent a car. I told the brother I thought he had an obligation to make things right but I'm not forcing them to pay me, and if he chooses not to, that's his decision. He got a quote of his own from a different place for $560 (they never saw the actual damage) and we agreed he would pay me that much, which he did. We exchanged emails saying that we agreed $560 was acceptable and the matter was closed.\n\nToday I got an email saying he got a more official quote for $450 and wants the difference back. Is it wrong of me to think that's out of line, or should I give it back to him?\n\nTL;DR:",

Therefore everyone is great friends with the others and all goes well. Or does it? \n\nIt doesn't. Jay is 33, married and father of 3 kids, and he and I are the only smokers, therefore we take our breaks together. **In the past few weeks** I have felt that he is being very \"affectionate\", generally standing too close to me and trying to touch me whenever he can get away with it, very innocently.\n\nFor instance he'll ask for my lighters and brush my fingers with his, he is also encroaching in my personal space: he inches forward, i inch back, and we can literally move meters away from the original spot where we stood like that). \n\nOur lab has a professional IM program and he often starts conversations which i do my best to cut short, but he does that more and more often. He uses pet names (the kind that can pass as casual such as \"cocotte\" - we're french), etc.\n\nI have a boyfriend (all my colleagues know that) and I have told him about it, and he was concerned and asked me to be careful, but did not really know **how to de-escalate what is apparently starting to escalate**.\n\nWhich is why I come here for advice: how can i de-escalate in a way that won't make Jay wounded in his pride (I'm worried he'd start a rumor on how I tried to sleep with him or smth out of spite and ruin my professional life, **I still have 2 years of PhD to complete**) ?\n\nNB: names were obviously changed\n\nTL;DR:",

I bought a laptop in august 2 years ago, and found out that it had been pulled from production short time after I had bought it. I soon realized why.\nWithin 3 months of purchase the mouse button had stopped working. Within 6 months, the battery started letting out. After 11 months, the laptop started being unable to recharge all together. I then turned it in, and through my 2-year warranty got it fixed within a month. 2 weeks after getting it back, the mouse button stopped working again. Slowly, the one speaker it had (yes, one) started worsening, and had become unbearable. Recently, the battery started dying again, and it could only go 20 minutes from a full recharge until it was dead. Additionally, the jack-stick was getting worse (had to jiggle headset a lot to get proper sound), the enter key had fallen off and so on. Today I called HP and asked what they could do about it. All they said was that the warranty had worn off (2 years have passed), and they couldn't do anything about it. Mind you, the only things that needed fixing, were the ones that were repaired a year ago (and yes, I did emphasize this point). Today I went down to the place where I bought it from, and explained the situation. They said, that they would take the battle with HP from me, but that I could expect the reparation time to exceed a month.\n\nLaptop: HP Compaq 615 15.6\" X2 QL-64 160GB 2GB HD3200\nFuck this shitty fucking laptop.\n\nTL;DR:",

Me foolishly just took it at face value and was just like whatever. went on the trip with my friends went out for drinks that night and the subject got brought up. They know about the light history and all the effort i have been putting into this whole thing and then after asking them to be honest and how I'd prefer them to just tell me what they think instead of attempting to spare my feelings and sugar coating it all. well they start talking, much if it was what i was expected/already knew, then our date was brought up from earlier that week. Well, in talking to a female friend she brought up the thought that from her experience she feels that the reason I finally got my date was because the \"lady friend\" I was trying so hard to romance basically knew I was trying and felt bad and decided to give me a pity date just so she wouldn't feel bad or like a bitch for shooting me down.

So, my boyfriend \"Matt\" and I have been together for almost a year now. He's incredible, and I think we work incredibly together. We've had our issues, but we're always able to overcome them. He lives about an hour away, and we work opposite schedules, so we really only see each other once a week. I work M-Th 7-5, and his days are always different, but usually from 4pm-2am. Because he works so late, he also sleeps late, so there's only really a few hours between the time he wakes up and goes to work that we're able to talk. And even then, it's just a few texts here and there, so I like to see him every chance I get. \n\nRecently (past month, maybe) he's been getting days off that match up with mine, and I'm ecstatic because that means we get to spend more time together! Or so I thought. He's still really only been wanting to plan spending one night a week together. Which, idk. Kind of bothers me. He goes and does his smash stuff (video game tourneys and stuff) instead, or hangs out with his friends, or stays home and plays games. Which all makes him so happy so I don't want to stop him from doing it, or say something that'll make him feel bad. But like, I want to spend all the time with him. I love being around him, whether we're sitting in his room watching Netflix or out doing stuff, I just like to be with him whenever I can. I do understand that it's important for him to have his time for himself, but I still get sad over him choosing these other things over me. \n\nDo you guys have any suggestions on how to work on not being upset by that, or a way to let him know it upsets me without being passive aggressive?\n\nTL;DR:",

Cut a long story short, he is my ideal guy and we texted everyday for about a month. After various meetings at our local bar with friends and attending a few parties together, we slept together. About a week or so after that I spent the night at his place and we did nothing but cuddle and chat (I told him no sex until a date, he was fine with it and the night was the most perfect ever!!). Then on planning a date for a few days later he became distant over text and cancelled the date two hours before. Sucky I know! He then stopped texting me completely and ignored the few I sent him, obviously I was totally confused on wtf was going on. Just this week I bumped into him at our local bar where he came up to me and apologized for being an ass and that he had just gotten back together with his on and off again ex of four years, they weren't dating while we were a thing he says but he spent the night continuing coming up to me and dancing and getting defensive if another guy approached me by taking me by the hand and getting mad if another guy even accidentally bumped into me. He kept telling me how beautiful I was and that any guy would be lucky to have me and how he wishes it could be him. He is honestly still the perfect guy in my eyes, and while yes I know this can't continue because he has a girl and while he has broken my heart I can't help him do it to someone else.

We are very serious, and he refers to me as the love of his life. I love him a lot too - sometimes I wonder how I landed such an amazing guy. \n\nWe skyped last night and it came up that he hadn't hooked up with anyone and I had been hooking up with a guy at my school and he didn't take it well. He didn't guilt trip me or anything even though I know for a fact that he's been avoiding very attractive girls that have been asking him out (he's very charismatic and good-looking, also helps that he's 21 and has already made millions on his own).

He's a good looking guy. That being said, when I found out that he had low self esteem, I (stupidly) thought to myself that maybe I could fix that.

He never answered back, which I am very glad about. I didn't think things through; if he did message back, I wouldn't have known what to say. I am not attracted to him, I just think he's good looking and it's always nice to hear compliments like that.\n\nAnyways, my boyfriend saw the message one day because I left my facebook open while I was at work.

I guess I need to make it clear somehow that I don't like him, that I was just trying to give him a compliment... but without being a bitch? I really don't know.

With the additional information gained from the PHQ-9 score, one or more treatment changes occurred during 40% of these clinical contacts. Changing the dosage of antidepressant medication and adding another medication were the most common treatment changes recorded by psychiatrists, followed by starting or increasing psychotherapy and by switching or initiating antidepressants.

There was this stand when you first walked in just full of junk, or what other people might call knick knacks. It was scattered everywhere and you were pretty much forced to walk through this booth to get anywhere else because their stuff was so scattered. Briefly looking through it, everything was priced at a few bucks, nothing interesting, so we continued on. \n\nFast forward a couple hours, we're on our way out and we have to walk through the same booth we can in at. Well as luck would have it, I accidentally knocked over this ridiculous 6 inch eagle statue and shattered it. We all just kind of stopped in our tracks, including the people running the booth, had this awkward pause, just staring at each other. You would thing it would be one of those things where it was a complete accident, they had so much junk already, I was just a kid and maybe they'd just brush it off and I'd apologize and life would go on,  but this lady starts yelling quite loud, \"Well!!?? Are you going to pay for it???\". It was so embarassing and my mom of course was apologizing and saying she'll pay for it. This lady was making a scene over a little crappy eagle. \n\nWe didn't even look at the sticker on it, because it was shattered and we didn't really want to get anywhere near the rest of their maze of breakables so my mom asks how much she wanted for it. This lady looks at her husband or whomever he was and they give each other a deceiving smirk and she says $20. Are you kidding me!? My mom was livid. She handed her 20 bucks and said a few choice words knowing she had just gotten completely ripped off and she didn't speak for the rest of the two hour drive home. \n\n9 years later and we still talk about that damn 20 dollar eagle. It's so funny now. My mom claims she should've at least picked up the broken pieces and took them with her. HA!\n\nTL;DR:",

I know him well and pretty much adore the guy.\n\nHe doesn't smoke every day, usually it is more like once or twice a week, but when he does he gets exceptionally stoned. I smoke with him occasionally, probably close to once or twice a month. I don't have a problem with marijuana at all, but I've never been the chill out and smoke a bowl type, I'm too energetic and type A for that to really sound appealing very often. Anyhow, normally he is a pretty affectionate guy, but when he is stoned he isn't very touchy and doesn't respond to my touch as much. In the beginning of our relationship it really worried me, because I didn't realize the correlation and thought that my new awesome boyfriend was losing interest in me. Also, he gets pretty unresponsive in conversation. The other night we had been talking about a problem I had over text, he invited me over to talk about it with him/comfort me later that night. When I showed up he had been smoking, and that made it much harder to get feedback from him like I wanted.\n\nI don't want him to stop, he enjoys it and it is a fairly important thing to him and his friends.

We dated, then she friendzoned me, then she invited me over to watch \"Mad Men\" with her and her roommate. Roomie disappeared, episode ended, I drove off, then she called me and asked me to come back. We had sex. I was confused since we were non-romantic and just friends.\n\nWe start and continue dating for a few weeks, and our last date ended with sex and then a series of statements that left me feeling not-so-great.\n\n1). She got drunk on Mad Men night and \"tried me out\" to make sure we had chemistry.\n\n2). She is hesitant to be official and listed bad relationships as well as her not being used to just dating one guy at a time as possible reasons for hesitation.\n\n3). She said she is worried I am too attached to her because we talk every day for hours upon end. I told her she initiates all our conversations, which I enjoy, but, I never ever initiate. As I expected, she stopped initiating conversations with me after this.\n\n4). Her most recent comments were that she feels she may have not followed her instincts, that she questions our intimate chemistry, and that I may have \"tricked her\" by my overt charm and persuasion into liking me.\n\nCan anyone help me make sense of this? Is #1 slightly abusive or messed up in any way?\n\nFactors to weigh-in: every female she is close with she describes as \"broken\" and hopeless to find a stable relationship - she is very judgmental, hyper-critical, and sees herself as everyone's place of stability and voice of reason. She says she has a rare joy and self-awareness which preclude her from requiring any attention from anyone. She projects like crazy. She is a private teacher who teaches rich people's kids one-on-one. She is very controlling. She takes, takes, takes, but she has not given me much in our time together.

Conflicting feelings. What's my next move?\n\nText: Some background: We met one month ago, I found her incredibly attractive and wanted to know more about her. Started messaging each other and chatting when we were together. We don't have a lot in common, but like to hear about each other's interests. Asked her on a date but discovered she's seeing another guy (who I had no idea exists).\n\n----\nNow for current matters: Typically I try to distance and preoccupy myself when I need to get over something. That's not really an option in this case. We are both going to be working together in two small academic related clubs, so we're going to be seeing each other often and will be working together. I'm also a very outgoing guy, and like to organize things with friends. I've already invited her to an event I'm hosting. I'm worried I'm going to get very frustrated being in constant contact, but it will bother me to exclude her in the future. With this coming year being my most important year at university, I'd like to avoid issues when I can.\n\nAs much as I'd like to win her over, I feel like that will cause more issues than I'm willing to deal with, especially when it means interfering with an existing relationship. However, there's no evidence on facebook that she has a boyfriend and I've never seen her with a guy, but he may be long-distance or simply busy. She made a point of how I couldn't have known she was seeing someone. When I asked her if she would prefer I restrain our friendship, she said she enjoyed talking to me, wanted things to continue, and told me not to worry about possible issues between us.\n\nDo I try to cut her away? Is she trying to tell me things are ending with the boyfriend? Do I just need to deal with it? \n\nObviously I'm going to want see things in a way where I get the girl, but I'm thinking I should tell her I need some time away. Is there a good way to do this? I'm not afraid to be honest, but I don't want it to sound harsh because we're going to need to work together.\n\nTL;DR:",

He does not have much time to spend with me since his work is taking most of his time even in the evenings, so I often get to see him only two hours in the week. \nHe is often in a good mood, but when he isn't, he sometimes calls me just to yell at me and ask me for help but then chastises me because \"I suck and I don't understand what he is going through anyway.\" He always calls about an hour after to apologise and tell me he should treat me in a better way. \n\nI am currently undergoing a depression after having been harassed at my workplace over the beginning of the year. He has stood by me through the whole ordeal, but has recently begun to let me know he feels I should \"try harder to get on with life\" because it weighs on him too much. He also often tries to pressure me into having sex, and even though I do not give in (except once but my feelings afterwards scared me out of ever repeating that mistake), it does make me feel guilt and wonder whether I am a proper girlfriend.\n\nWhenever I talk about him to my girlfriends, one of them always seems to feel like I should leave him and tells me I speak like a battered woman. I feel like they exaggerate as they do not know him and I only speak of my relationship when things turn bad, even though my boyfriend is I think a good person at the core.\n\nTL;DR:",

We solved it by agreeing that I would never have to be in his presence anymore and she would not meet up with him alone anymore.\n\n1 month ago I found out that in fact, she was still hanging out with him alone.

I got pissed but now she swore that she would never do it anymore and always tell me when she will see him.\n\nMy girlfriend just graduated and found a job in another city for 6 months.

Not gonna be a quick fix, need advice, particularly from the ladies of this sub.\n\nText: Will do my best to keep this short: \n\nHave been dating a girl for the last 9 months. She lives approx 2 hours away (a stressor, I know). I'll say up front, although I know it is naive, but I have been convinced she was \"the one\" since our first night together. She reciprocated those feelings, and we lived that way for some time. Recently, we have faced a significant life event together in which she claims I was not there for her, and the fallout from that has lead to this break. I don't want to get into what all happened in the interest of the reader's time, but at this point we are both facing significant pressures from our respective graduate programs. She's preparing a thesis and I'm studying for my boards. If nothing else, it makes sense to do this break now as both of our plates are full and time together would be limited whether we were \"official\" or not. She is claiming she needs space, so I'm going to give it to her. \n\nThe issue now is (obviously our future is uncertain but moreso) we're both going to be extremely busy over the next couple months, and I ultimately want to get back with her. She says that she could see it, but isn't 100% sure. I know that I'm putting myself out there in trying with someone someone that isn't into it, but stranger things have happened than couples to take time apart and get back together. \n\nSo, fellow redditors, my concern is I want to show her that I still care, and I'm still here for her through this. I tell her that all the time, and she has even told me that I over-saturate conversation with telling her how much I love/care for her. She's not easily influenced by myself or anyone, but her best friend as well as her roommate aren't fond of me. What are some things that I can do to show her that I still care, although I won't be seeing her much (if at all) over the next couple months? \n\nSorry for the wall of text..\n\nTL;DR:",

During that time (between 6th and 12th), a lot of people accused him of being gay. He had almost all female friends, was into art instead of sports, spent time on his appearance, had more 'feminine' mannerisms. I realize that's a bs way to tell if someone's actually gay or not so I had no hesitations when I started dating him towards the end of college. \n\nSince we've been dating though he's only initiated sex maybe 6 times, will give me a peck but doesn't enjoy the act of kissing for longer than a few seconds, has never complimented my looks in person-even when I lost 30 pounds and got to a healthy weight. \n\nThose things have made me wonder if he's ever been open to the idea of being attracted to men maybe more than women. I tried bringing the conversation up about 3 months ago but it failed miserably as he said no he hasn't been open to it because he's not attracted to guys at all and that he's not gay.\n\n---\n\nFast forward to yesterday: I was on his iPad and looked at his search history (I know. I snooped and invaded his privacy - not okay). What I found though was weeks of gay porn. Gay bdsm, gay orgies, straight men being done by gay men. These were the majority, only with a few teen porn links in between. To make it worse I saw 3+ casual dating sites like Ashley Madison. \n\nMy instinct is to break things off but we've been dating so long and I love him so much. I just don't even know how to go about it. I feel lied to and I've been crying off and on but the other side of me wants to be there for him since I know his Christian parents would not be accepting if he is bi.

Any support would be appreciated.\n\nText: By LDR, we only lived two hours away.  However, the aspect that really hurt us was we could never find time for each other due to our schedules, other than texting and Skyping.  It's common that we could only see each other once a month.  I've already posted the following somewhere else but here it goes:\n\nBackground infoL  I've been seeing her for over a year.  She moved year two years ago from the Philippines.  Our relationship was great except the fact we live two hours apart and our work schedules are not compatible. She is only off work during certain days of the the week and I'm only off work on weekends. \n\nHowever, we have reached a breaking point. We haven't physically seen each other in over 2 months and she begged me to come see her Tuesday and Wednesday when she was off work this week. I couldn't because I had to work and couldn't get off on such short notice. She has become very depressed (as well as upset and mad) as a result of this. It hurts me the most because I feel her depression is my fault.\n\nI have in the past, suggested many alternatives for this relationship to work. Changing her schedule or offering her to live with me so she can find work and we can live together. She always refused because her parents would not approve of it.\n\nI made a tough decision yesterday and let her go. We're two different people living two different lives that cannot be reconciled.  We cannot handle the distance and time apart from each other. I.e. her depression.\n\nSince the break-up, she is doing NC and it hurts really bad.  (Since she's not from the US she often needs help or guidance with things)  She's somehow convinced that I'm leaving her because I'm \"tired\" of her (Her past BFs did this to her).  I still love her but I know I can't prolong the situation any longer.  \n\nAny advice, input, support, or prayers would be appreciated.  Heart breaks are tough and I need to vent.\n\nTL;DR:",

We are pretty flirtatious towards one another at work and we wait for the other person to be off so we can walk each other to our cars. One day I asked to exchange numbers so she can text me when she gets home. So we start texting a little and this is where I start to become bewildered, I'll shoot her a text and it will take hours to respond or sometimes she won't respond at all. This didn't really bother me too much initially, because she just might not be a big texter and she was still showing slight interest she even tried to convince me to get a Disneyland Annual pass so we can go together. But then last week we started to talk about hanging out on one of our days off, once we decided on a day I started suggesting things to do but she didn't respond until the evening of the date we were supposed to hang out saying that she couldn't and that she'd make it up to me. It kinda irked me that it took her literally days to tell me she couldn't hang out (She wasn't working between that time). Then last Sunday we were texting again and I mentioned that I really enjoy our conversations whilst walking to our cars and yet again she refuses to respond, leaving me in the same predicament.\n\nI have a pretty fair amount of relationship experience, I've had girlfriends, rejected girls and have been rejected by girls, but I haven't been in an situation like this before. When we are around each other we are always flirting, (which she doesn't do with other guys there from what I've observed) but when it comes to outside of work she is very distant. Now I would normally just put it out there that I'm interested and just go from there, but since we are coworkers I don't want to create a potentially awkward situation that might affect our work environment.

I wasn't exactly stoked about the drive out there, but my friend always threw awesome parties, so I knew it would be worth it.\n\nWhen I arrived at the party I grabbed my wallet to pay for some beer that some one got for me. When I opened it I realized I had forgotten all my money...I was severely disappointed, no booze for me. I figured I could at least supply the tunes so I turned on my car and plugged in my Ipod. (This party was in the woods by the way.)\n\nMe being as awesome as I am, with the memory of an elderly person with Alzheimer's, forgot that the battery in my car had been terrible since I bought it. As soon as I walked over to the car to turn the engine over and let it run to charge the battery, it died...So not only did I not have anything to drink, for the time being there was no music and my car was dead.\n\nLater one of my friends showed up and he was nice enough to give me a jump with his car. To access the battery in his car there is a plastic cover that has to be taken off, this is important for later. So we hooked up our cars and let it run for awhile, but my car never turned over. We figured out the positive end of my friends battery wasn't reaching the positive cable, so we decided to use my brothers car instead.\n\nAs I closed the hood of my friends car I heard a loud snap and the hood popped up. I knew something was right so I went to open the hood up again, but it wouldn't open and was scraping against the metal surrounding the windshield on the left side. When I closed the hood the plastic battery cover had pushed the hood off the hinge and dislocated it while smashing the battery cover...I felt like a dick. \n\nEventually my brothers car recharged my battery and all was well. I was extremely frustrated and fell bad for messing up my friends car and was as sober as a priest on Sunday while all my friends were drunk and having a good time.\n\nTL;DR:",

The repair for it was covered under Honda's service bulletin 10-048 and, after a few days, I was able to drive it home.\n\nFast forward three days later and I was over at a friend's so that he could help me change out my brake pads. He immediately noticed that there was transmission fluid leaking from the engine, along with power steering fluid from the power steering pump. Remember the coolant leak I had before? The same friend helped me diagnosed that, and he can definitively say that the only thing leaking that day was the coolant.\n\nSure enough, I take it back to the dealership to have them fix it, and they diagnosed that a seal on the axle had gone bad and the power steering fluid pump was leaking. Before engine work began on the car, the dealership did a full safety report and ONLY found the leaking power steering fluid pump (although the leak was made worse after maintenance). The leaking seal on the axle was not mentioned at all on the safety report, and when I asked the service adviser if they could comp it since it was clear the issue existed AFTER maintenance, he assured me that he couldn't. He admitted that the shifting of engine components could have caused it but since the seal was due to be replaced anyways (because of mileage), he could not provide the axle repair for free. The safety report before work did not mention any axle seal leak, yet, after you worked on the car, it began leaking and I have to pay for it?\n\nTL;DR:",

We were close friends for 2.5 years before we got together. We're in a bit of a situation. The girl who was supposed to live with me starting in May had to push it back until August because the girl who was supposed to sublease her current apartment over the summer backed out. She can't afford to pay two rents and can't find another person to take the apartment, so she's going to have to stay where she is. My boyfriend had plans to live with one of his good friends, but his friend recently decided he would rather live in a house with his band mates, leaving my boyfriend without a roommate/apartment.  \n\nI've already signed the lease to my future apartment, so I'm pretty stuck there with no roommate until August. This is going to cost me an extra $500/month, which is difficult for me to afford right now. My boyfriend suggested that he could stay with me during those months and pay that half of the rent, which would help me financially and give him more time to find another place to stay. It definitely makes logical sense, but I'm worried that we're not in a place to live together yet. \n\nWe're still so young and we've only been together for about a year. Even if we'd only be living together for a few months, I'm scared it might negatively impact our relationship. I love spending time with him and we are going strong.

        "Write an excellent summary of the given text.\n\nTitle: Me [20M], my friends [20's M/F], they want to have an intervention for out mutual friend [23M] regarding his awful GF. I don't know if I should participate.\n\nText: Over the last few years I have become good friends with a group of people, most of who have known each other since elementary school. John, a member of the group and good friend, has been with his girlfriend Erin for 2 years. Recently, everyone in the group (except John and Erin) has discussed the need to hold an intervention for John as they think he needs to break up with Erin. They want me to participate in the intervention, however I am not sure if I should. \n\nSince joining the group, I have heard countless stories about how hated Erin is. Initially, I was friendly towards Erin, however over time I have grown to strongly dislike her and her treatment of John.\n\nEvery member of the group hates Erin and disses her behind her back. She has never made an effort to be nice and we are all tired of her nasty attitude. Erin doesn't allow John to attend events which she can't go to, and always invites herself to guy's nights and other events where she is not welcome. When she is invited, she usually turns up at least 1 hour late and only talks to John. Any questions asked of her receive one worded replies. It also came out that John's parent's find Erin rude and disrespectful, and want him to end things with her. She often spends days at John's house (he lives with his parents) without their knowledge and doesn't greet them when they see her.\n\nErin also has drug issues. A few months ago, Erin was unable to pay her dealer and John paid thousands of dollars to cover the debt. Despite this, she continues to use hard drugs, and also smokes heavily. \n\nWhile I very strongly dislike Erin, I am not sure if it is my place to partake in the intervention. I haven't known John as long as the others, and I don't want to drive John away and make him feel completely attacked. I'm not sure what to do.\n\nTL;DR:",

Past fentanyl access was primarily oral or dermal via prescription fentanyl patch diversion. One factor potentially driving this increase in fatalities is the change in route of administration. Rapid intravenous (IV) fentanyl can produce chest wall rigidity. We evaluated post-mortem fentanyl and norfentanyl concentrations in a recent surge of lethal fentanyl intoxications.', \"Fentanyl related deaths from the Franklin County coroner's office from January to September 2015 were identified. Presumptive positive fentanyl results were confirmed by quantitative analysis using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) and were able to quantify fentanyl, norfentanyl, alfentanyl, and sufentanyl.\", '48 fentanyl deaths were identified. Mean fentanyl concentrations were 12.5\\u2009ng/ml, (range 0.5\\u2009ng/ml to\\u2009>40\\u2009ng/ml). Mean norfentanyl concentrations were 1.9\\u2009ng/ml (range none detected to 8.3\\u2009ng/ml). No appreciable concentrations of norfentanyl could be detected in 20 of 48 cases (42%) and were less than 1\\u2009ng/ml in 25 cases (52%). Elevated fentanyl concentrations did not correlate with rises in norfentanyl levels. In several cases fentanyl concentrations were strikingly high (22\\u2009ng/ml and 20\\u2009ng/ml) with no norfentanyl detected.', 'The lack of any measurable norfentanyl in half of our cases suggests a very rapid death, consistent with acute chest rigidity. An alternate explanation could be a dose-related rapid onset of respiratory arrest. Deaths occurred with low levels of fentanyl in the therapeutic range (1-2\\u2009ng/ml) in apparent non-naïve opiate abusers. Acute chest wall rigidity is a well-recognized complication in the medical community but unknown within the drug abuse community.

Or have had, for that matter. The thing is about a month ago my husband totaled our car. We're super tight on money so my in laws offered to loan us about the amount of our income tax returns so we could purchase a nice new car. My father is completely absent and my mother is virtually homeless with mental illness- so it wasn't like I could turn to them for help here.

Everyone gets a turn opening and it finally comes to me. My gift says \"for photoshell and her husband\" I open it up and it's a frying pan. A cheap ugly frying pan. My husband got his own gift- as did everyone else. My husband even got one with his name. It was weird but I shrugged it off. Shortly there after we drove to my sisters house. I jokingly mentioned what had happened and everyones jaw dropped slightly. It dawned on me what a crappy gift I was given. I honestly just want to donate the damned frying pan because it upsets me just looking at it. We did not need a frying pan or any type of kitchen gear. It was completely random.

Earlier today I summoned enough willpower to talk about it with GF. \n\nShe was absolutely devastated, which breaks my heart. It may be hard for some to believe, but I love this girl. I want to be with her for the rest of my life, and I can't believe I fucked up so badly. I will never, ever do anything to hurt her ever again. I know that this is going to be a long road ahead of us, and I'm wondering what things I should keep in mind to help her heal and rebuild her trust in me.\n\nTL;DR:",

Need advice.\n\nText: At the end of May, I met a wonderful girl. We hit it off instantly and feelings were mutual; no games involved. We got really close, shared some of our deepest secrets, the words I love you came naturally, and basically I had never felt so strongly for someone so quickly.\n\nProblem is, she goes to school 11 driving hours away. Her parents house and my parents house are right by each other, but unfortunately we go to school miles and miles apart. It is our senior year, and at first we didn't think it would make sense to be serious about this relationship when we started school (which is now), and just hope that we would meet up again after the school year. But, obviously, the more time we spent together, the closer we got, the more attached we got, and now we find ourselves in a long distance relationship. \n\nI've done this once before, with only a 2 hour separation and it didn't work out for other reasons, so my view on LDR's isn't completely shot. But i didn't want to get into another one because I loved the freedom college provided and it is my senior year. However, this girl came along, and completely changed my mind. I am convinced that if we get through this LDR, I will marry her. She is everything I want and more.\n\nI came here to seek advice from you wonderful redditors, hopefully who have experienced similar circumstances. If it was the beginning of my sophomore year things would be different, because I dont think I could do ~3 years of LDR. But 1 year doesn't seem so bad. I know it will suck at times, and communication is key, but what are some tips, tricks, advice, words of encouragement that would help me get through this with her?\n\nTL;DR:",

The same results were observed with all 37 retransplantations. Survival of second simultaneous pancreas and kidney transplantations was better than survival of second pancreas after kidney. Patient survival was excellent (89% at 5 years). Pancreas retransplantation had no impact on kidney graft function and survival (100% at 5 years).']",

We made 2 batches- about 20 muffins- and after indulging in a few ourselves, I decided to being some home to my family.  \n  \nMy friend lives only about a mile away from my house, but I didn't feel like carrying a box of muffins (as a surprise for my family) and my nice tablet for a mile, so I called my mom and asked if she could drive me, since I know she wasn't doing anything. She said I needed to walk. Well, I was quite pissed at that- I'm carrying muffins for them for a mile? In 90+F weather? In a hoodie?

My ex girlfriend and I were in an hour and half long distance relationship.  We always had a great time together, I felt like I could say anything to her, she's smart, funny, and beautiful. I miss spending time with her, and I'm not sure if I ended the relationship too soon as I still have strong feelings for her.  \n\nI ended the relationship with her because I didn't feel right in the relationship.  She has self esteem issues that causes herself to be unhealthy.  She will eat too much and is overweight.  The catch 22 is that she feels bad about herself because she does eat and she has told me this after the breakup.  My reason for breaking up with her is not because she's overweight but because she doesn't seem to love herself and is not working on herself to be a healthier person.  She is always putting others first myself including.  \n\nI want to be there for her but I also don't want to come across as controlling and tell her how to eat.  I am a person that is always about self improving.  I know I'm not perfect but I also believe it's important to be in shape and eat healthy. I am open to her telling me what I can improve on especially if we can both motivate each other in achieving our goals.  \n\nI care too much to completely end the relationship without giving her a chance.  I want her to be happy with herself and if I can be the one to motivate herself into being the best person she can be I will continue to love her and admire her for it.  As of right now if she isn't loving herself than how can I love her back especially if her current lifestyle is so unhealthy. \n\nI am seeing my ex girlfriend this week and I was wondering how I can bring this up to her without hurting her feelings. From what she told me this week it sounds like she's willing to change her lifestyle.  Not for me but for herself which gives me some hope that we can continue our relationship.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nTL;DR:",

A range of colours was chosen to represent changes in pain intensity. Aching pain was consistently identified as being associated with colours such as grey or black, whereas sharp pain was described using a wider selection of colours.

        "Write an excellent summary of the given text.\n\nTitle: Should I [21 M] just give up on her [18F]?\n\nText: In advance, English is not my first language.\n\nSo 3 months ago I started regulary texting and hanging out with a friend of 2 years, lets call her Carmen. After a month I realized that I have feelings for her, and asked her out for an offical date. Carmens first response was, that she wasnt sure, if she wants to go on a date with me, but then she replied with a yes and even planned the date. The date went pretty good, we had lots of fun together, but even tough there was much body contact, we didnt kiss at the end.\n\nA day later I asked her if she wants to go on a second date, and she replied again, with \"I dont know\". So I waited a week and asked her again. Her reply was something like \"I like you, but I am not ready for a relationship\". I told her, that it is ok for me, and I hope that we can stay friends.\n\nI accepted it as a No and was ready to move on, but the next day a close friend of her spoke with me, and told me that Carmen talked with her about me, and that it was not a no. The conversation was pretty lengthy, but the essencse of it was, that Carmen isnt sure if she likes me in a romantical way, and that we should just spend some more time with each other, to let her find out.\n\nThis was 1 month ago. But since then we didnt hangout anymore and only rarely texted. If I chat with her I get the feeling that she isnt really interested in chatting with me.\n\nNow I am confused. Doesnt she want any conntact with me anymore? But why did her friend then tell me I should spend time with her? I am not sure if i should talk with her about it, or if I should just completly stop messaging her and wait for her to contact me.\n\nTL;DR:",

        "Write an excellent summary of the given text.\n\nTitle: Looking for advice on possibly switching daycare\n\nText: My wife and I are having a bit of a dilemma with our daycare situation for our eight month old daughter and are not sure how we should proceed.   We spent a lot of time looking for a good daycare before she was even born and found a home daycare that we really liked that would have an opening.  Unfortunately due to a mix-up, when I contacted her to discuss start date after my daughter was born, we were informed that we no longer had a spot.  We then contacted the provider that had been a very close second and when we found out she still had an opening we decided to take it.\n\nShe has been attending the daycare for around 4 months now and things have been going well for the most part.  It is very close to our house, we feel very safe leaving our daughter there, she is loved by everybody there (providers and other children), she has also been flexible with early drop off or picking up a little late on a couple occasions.  While nothing bad has happened, lately we have been thinking that maybe she could be in a better situation.  There have been a few things that I first dismissed as nothing to be concerned with, but I feel like they have been adding up over time.  My wife would also like to see more organization and structure to things. \n\nMy wife recently found another home daycare in town that appears to provide a little more of what we want.  They have a good sized play room set up in the basement, there is a little more focus on structured time and activities such as stories, songs, crafts, and learning. \n\nI guess what it all comes down to is that we like our current daycare provider, but feel like we might want a little more than we're currently getting.  If we decide to switch, how do we go about telling her?  Everybody has been happy with the current situation, but but my wife seems to be growing more uneasy with it and is emotionally struggling with how to make the switch.\n\nTL;DR:",

        "<body>\n\t\t<section>\n\t\t\t<p>بھٹو</p>\n\t\t\t<p>ذوالفقار علی بھٹو مرحوم کی برسی پر ایک بنیادی سوال دامن گیر ہے: سوال یہ نہیں آ پ بھٹو سے مریضانہ نفرت کرتے ہیں یا مجنونانہ عقیدت رکھتے ہیں، سوال یہ ہے کہ جس طریقے سے ان کی جان لی گئی کیا وہ درست، جائز اور منصفانہ طریقہ تھا؟ ۔۔۔۔بھٹو کے بارے میں سپریم کورٹ میں صدارتی ریفرنس میں وفاق کے معاون وکیل کی حیثیت سے جو میرے مشاہدات ہیں وہ میں آپ کے سامنے رکھ دیتا ہوں۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>لیکن آغاز ان نفسیاتی گرہوں سے جن کے ساتھ میں جو ان ہوا۔میرا تعلق اس نسل سے ہے جسے بھٹو نفرت کا زہر فکری وراثت میں دیا گیا۔بھٹو کا ذکر چلے تواپنے بچپن کے دن یاد آ جاتے ہیں۔کس شرح صدر کے ساتھ ہم کندھے اچکا کر کہہ دیا کرتے تھے: بھٹو تو اسلام کا دشمن تھا۔شاید اس لیے کہ گاؤں میں ہمارے خاندان کے مفادات مذہبی سیاست سے وابستہ تھے۔چنانچہ دین کی تعبیر کے جملہ حقوق ہمارے نام محفوظ تھے اور ہمارا خاندان اپنی ساری' ہم نصابی سر گرمیوں 'کے باوجود اس بات کا استحقاق رکھتا تھا کہ کھڑے کھڑے کسی کی بھی اسلام دوستی کا آ ملیٹ بنا دے۔چنانچہ جب قبلہ امیر المومنین بقلم خود نے ریفرنڈم میں سوال پوچھا: اسلام چاہتے ہو؟ اور شرح یہ رکھی کہ چاہتے ہو تو پھر میں اگلے پانچ سالوں کے لیے نفاذ شریعت کے لیے صدر بن رہا ہوں تو مردِ مومن مردِ حق کے لیے نعرے لگا لگا کر ہمارے گلے بیٹھ گئے۔ہمارے گاؤں میں صرف تین ووٹ نکلے جنہوں نے مردِ مومن کی اصل واردات کو سمجھا اور کہا ؛نہیں چاہتے۔بس پھر کیا تھا، ہم شریف سائیکلوں والے اور ڈاکٹر پھینا کی دکانوں کے آگے سے گزرتے تو نفرت سے تھوک دیتے۔کم بختوں نے اسلام دشمنی میں حد ہی کر دی تھی۔ہم سب راسخ العقیدہ مسلمان تھے ،تھوڑی دیر بعد منہ اٹھاتے اور چیختے: مردِ مومن مردِ حق۔۔۔۔۔آج سوچتا ہوں جہالت کتنی بڑی نعمت ہوتی ہے۔ہم کتنے آسودہ تھے۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>جب میں نے اسلامک یونیورسٹی اسلام آباد میں انگریزی ادب میں ماسٹرز کی کلاس میں داخلہ لیا تو ملک معراج خالد یہاں کے ریکٹر تھے۔ان کا تعلق پی پی پی سے تھا اور میں صالحین کے گاؤں سے آیا اپنی ذات میں ایک چھوٹا سا امیر المومنین تھا۔پہلا سوال ہی امیر المومنین صاحب نے یہ سوچا: اسلامک یونیورسٹی میں ملک معراج خالد کا کیا کام؟میری گستاخیاں بڑھتی گئیں،خبر ملک معراج خالد تک پہنچ گئی۔ایک روز میری طلبی ہوئی۔شعبہ انگریزی کے سربراہ پروفیسر ایس ایم اے رؤف نے حکم دیا جاؤ تمہیں ریکٹر صاحب نے طلب کیا ہے۔جل تو جلال تو کا ورد کرتے حاضر ہوا تو یہاں کا منظر ہی اور تھا۔چند منٹ کی ملاقات کے بعد جب میں باہر آیا تو محسوس ہوا دل وہیں چھوڑے جا رہا ہوں۔تعلق بڑھتا گیا۔ایک شام میں اورافتخار سید ملک معراج خالد کے گھر گئے تو اندر سے قرآن کی تلاوت کی آواز سنائی دی۔ملک صاحب کے سارے احترام کے باوجود میں نے حیرت سے پوچھا: افتخار یار یہ تو مذہبی آدمی ہیں۔افتخار نے طنزیہ کہا: امیر المومنین صاحب کسی اور کو بھی مسلمان سمجھ لیا کرو۔۔۔۔ٹوٹ پھوٹ کا عمل شروع ہو چکا تھا۔تب پہلی دفعہ میں نے سوچا ،جہالت کتنی بڑی نعمت ہوتی ہے۔ہم اپنی خیالی دنیا میں کتنے آسودہ تھے۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>ایک روز ملک معراج خالد نے مجھے ایک کتاب دی اور کہا: اسے ضرور پڑھنا۔کتاب کا نام تھا\" <annotation lang=\"en\">The Myth of Independence</annotation> \"۔یہ ایک نئے بھٹو سے میرا تعارف تھا۔اس بھٹو کو تو میں جانتا ہی نہ تھا۔فیصل مسجد کے شمال میں ایک درخت تلے بیٹھ کر ایس ایم اے روؤف صاحب کی کلاس بنک کر کے میں نے یہ ساری کتاب پڑھ ڈالی۔بار بار یہ خیال آتا رہا: اگر یہ کتاب بھٹو کی ہے تو بھٹو سے نفرت کیسے کی جا سکتی ہے۔۔۔۔۔اپنا گاؤں یاد آیا۔ساتھ وہی خیال پھر آیا:جہالت کتنی بڑی نعمت ہوتی ہے۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>شریعہ اکیڈیمی کی لائبریری کھنگالتے کھنگالتے ایک روز یہ انکشاف ہوا کہ اس ملک میں شراب پر پابندی اسی اسلام دشمن بھٹو نے لگائی تھی تو میں سر پکڑ کر بیٹھ گیا۔ایک روز میرے ہاتھ پارلیمنٹ کی وہ ساری کارروائی لگ گئی جس میں قادیانیوں کو غیر مسلم قرار دیا گیا تھا۔پہلی بار مجھے علم ہوا یہ کام بھی بھٹو کے دور میں ہوا تھا۔اب کے میں نے بھٹو کو اپنی نظر سے دیکھنا شروع کر دیا۔فکری اور نظری بیساکھیاں میں نے ایک طرف پھینک دیں اور اللہ کا شکر ہے آج تک ان کا سہارا نہیں لیا۔پاکستان کے ایٹمی پروگرام پر امریکہ نے اعتراض کیا تو بطور وزیر اعظم پاکستان بھٹو نے قومی اسمبلی میں جو تقریر کی وہ ہمت حوصلہ اور ویژن کا شاہکار ہے۔آج کی دنیا میں کوئی اپوزیشن رہنما بھی اس لہجے میں امریکہ کا ذکر نہیں کر سکتا۔اتنی جرات اور اتنا ویژن۔فیض نے ٹھیک ہی تو کہا تھا:</p>\n\t\t\t<p>\" کبھی تو سوچنا یہ تم نے کیا کیا لوگو</p>\n\t\t\t<p>یہ کس کو تم نے سر دار کھو دیا لوگو\"</p>\n\t\t\t<p>وقت دھیرے دھیرے گزرتا رہا اور ایک وقت آیا صدر پاکستان نے سپریم کورٹ میں بھٹو کی پھانسی پر صدارتی ریفرنس فائل کرنے کا فیصلہ کر لیا۔وزیرقانون ڈاکٹر بابر اعوان نے اس کیس میں مجھے بھی معاون وکیل کے طور پر منتخب کرنے کا عندیہ دیا۔انکار کی گنجائش ہی نہ تھی ،میرا تو یہ دلچسپی کا موضوع تھا۔بطور معاون وکیل جب میں نے اس کیس کا مطالعہ کرنا شروع کیا تو حیرتوں کے جہاں مجھ پر وا ہوتے گئے۔اتنا تو مجھے اندازہ تھا کہ بھٹو کے ساتھ نا انصافی ہوئی لیکن اس ناانصافی کا انداز اتنا شرمناک ہو گا اس کا میں نے کبھی تصور بھی نہیں کیا تھا۔جس جج کو بھٹو نے ترقی نہیں دی تھی وہ ناراض ہو کر رخصت پر بیرون ملک چلا جاتا ہے ، اس دوران ملک میں مارشل لاء لگتا ہے۔اسی جج کو بلا کر چیف جسٹس بنا دیا جاتا ہے۔وہ جج نجی محفلوں میں کہتا ہے بھٹو کو چھوڑوں گا نہیں۔بار ایسوسی ایشنز سے خطاب کرتا ہے تو کہتا ہے سوچ کر ووٹ دیا کرو ورنہ تم پر بھٹو جیسے لوگ مسلط ہوتے رہیں گے۔تعصب اور نفرت صاف عیاں ہے۔بھٹو درخواست کرتے ہیں آپ متعصب ہیں اس لیے یہ کیس نہ سنیں، جواب آتا ہے آپ کی درخواست مل گئی پہلے کیس کا فیصلہ کر لیں پھر آپ کی درخواست کو بھی دیکھ لیں گے۔بار بار منصب انصاف سے ارشاد ہوتا ہے تم سمجھتے کیا ہو خود کو؟سیلن زدہ کوٹھری میں بھٹو کو سانس کی تکلیف ہو جاتی ہے۔درخواست آتی ہے سماعت ملتوی کر دی جائے، سرکاری ڈاکٹر بھی کہتا ہے ان کی طبیعت ٹھیک نہیں ، اس کے باوجود شنوائی نہیں ہوتی۔جو جج بھٹو کی ضمانت لیتے ہیں ان کا وہ حشر کیا جاتا ہے کہ وہ افغانستان کے راستے ملک سے فرار ہو جاتے ہیں۔جس نے شراب پر پابندی لگائی، جس نے قادیانیوں کو کافر قرار دیا اسے عدالت نام کا مسلمان کہتی ہے۔بھٹو اس پر احتجاج کرتے ہیں لیکن عدالت اپنے الفاظ پر نادم نہیں ہوتی۔قتل کے بعد اس کی لاش کو برہنہ کر کے تصویر اتار کر ضیاء الحق کو دکھائی جاتی ہے تا کہ وہ تسلی کر سکے بھٹو کافر تھا یا مسلمان۔امیر المومنین کی تسلی تو ہوئی یا نہیں معلوم نہیں لیکن تقدیر کا جبر دیکھیے مردہ بھٹو بھی ضیاء کے ساتھ کیا کر گیا۔بھٹو کا ڈیتھ سرٹیفکیٹ بھی ایک معمہ ہے۔اس پر چار اپریل کی بجائے تین اپریل کی تاریخ ڈلی ہے۔ پھر ایک جگہ پر کاٹ کر کچھ ٹھیک کیا گیا ہے۔ڈیتھ سترٹیفکیٹ پر ڈاکٹر کے دستخط ہی موجود نہیں۔ ( یہ سارا ریکارڈ میں نے برادر مکرم وجاہت مسعود کو دے دیا ہے کیونکہ میں سمجھتا ہوں میرے پاس شاید ضائع ہو جاتا ۔وجاہت کا علمی ذوق اسے محفوظ رکھے گا۔وجاہت اگر بھٹو کا ڈیتھ سرٹیفکیٹ شیئر کر دیں تو یہ چیز ملاحظہ کی جا سکتی ہے ) یہ سب کیا کہانی بیان کر رہے ہیں؟</p>\n\t\t\t<p>ہمارا المیہ یہ ہے ہم خانوں میں بٹ چکے ہیں۔ہمارے دکھ بھی سانجھے نہیں رہے۔ہمارے اپنے اپنے مظلوم ہیں اور ہم صرف اپنے مظلوموں پر ہونے والے ظلم کی مذ مت کرتے ہیں۔بھٹو صرف پی پی پی کا نہیں تھا۔اپنے مزاج کی ساری خامیوں کے باوجود وہ ایک قومی لیڈر تھا۔وہ ہم سب کا تھا۔دکھ صرف پی پی پی کا نہیں کہ بھٹو میرا بھی تو تھا۔تعصب کی بات الگ ورنہ یہ برائے وزنِ بیت نہیں ایک حقیقت ہے کہ بھٹو زندہ ہوتا تو آج ہم ایک قوم ہوتے۔شناخت کے بحران میں ٹامک ٹوئیاں نہ مار رہے ہوتے۔شاید اسے مارا ہی اس لیے گیا تھا کہ ایک قوم پرست رہنما پرائی جنگوں کا ایندھن بننے کو تیار نہ ہوتا۔اس کے بعد ہمارے ساتھ جو ضیاء الحقیاں ہوئیں ان کے نتائج ہمارے سامنے ہیں۔</p>\n\t\t</section>\n\t</body>\n",

How to solve issues before next time?\n\nText: I met this girl around January, we went on a couple dates and it was just magic. About 3 months in we started to let our guard down more and show each other our true selves. We both had personal baggage that kept interfering and fights have been more and more frequent since. It has become clear recently that for this relationship to work we both need to make major changes in ourselves. She has made it pretty clear that she's not willing to, and the changes I have tried to make seem to go unnoticed.\n\nA couple days ago she asked for \"space to think\". Given how she is I'm pretty sure this is her way of beginning the break up process.

What my question is, how do I move on from here to work on my own issues, so that they don't rear up the next time I'm in a relationship?\n\nMost of my issues stem from jealousy. My previous girlfriend who I had been dating for 5 years cheated on me for the last 6 months of our relationship. I had never been jealous with her, never suspected anything, the thought never crossed my mind. I thought it hadn't effected me much, but when I started falling in love with this girlfriend, I found myself full of anxiety about it, constantly worrying about it, due to my previous relationship, and her lengthy sexual past. This led to my being a crazy, controlling asshole, hence part of the reason I've driven her away.\n\nMy question is, how do you work on it?

This paper reports an exploratory meta-analysis to investigate the relationship between reduced arm spasticity and improved arm function.', 'Individual data from stroke patients in two randomised controlled trials of intra-muscular botulinum toxin were pooled. The Modified Ashworth Scale (elbow, wrist, fingers) was used to calculate a \"Composite Spasticity Index\". Data from the arm section of the Barthel Activities of Daily Living Index (dressing, grooming, and feeding) and three subjective measures (putting arm through sleeve, cleaning palm, cutting fingernails) were summed to give a \"Composite Functional Index\". Change scores and the time of maximum change were also calculated.', 'Maximum changes in both composite measures occurred concurrently in 47 patients. In 26 patients the improvement in spasticity preceded the improvement in function with 18 showing the reverse. There was a definite relationship between the maximum change in spasticity and the maximum change in arm function, independent of treatment (rho = -0.2822, p = 0.0008, n = 137). There was a clear relationship between the changes in spasticity and in arm function in patients treated with botulinum toxin (Dysport) at 500 or 1000 units (rho = -0.5679, p = 0.0090, n = 22; rho = -0.4430, p = 0.0018, n = 47), but not in those treated with placebo or 1500 units.']",

I take and finish my dosage over 11 days, with all the symptoms other than the cough gone again, which is only barely there.

He still continued to talk about the plan he had concocted for my new visa and our relationship's future, and he told me every day that he loves me. \n\nThen the other night he went out drinking with a friend and sends me a text message saying he wants to be alone and do his own thing, that he misses being able to do his own thing. He wouldn't speak to me on the phone, and every question I asked him was met with a completely rude one-or-two word answer. He said he wants to slow down and that he still loves me but it isn't enough. I still have not spoken to him in person. Why would he say he wants to slow down when everything about moving forward has been his own idea??\n\nTL;DR:",

I go to university  in Montreal and she just recently transferred to a college upstate NY so we get to see each other much more now. The first semester of college was tough not getting to see her. But we managed to get through it, and we're both really happy now that we can see each other more.\n\nThe problem:\nI spent the past weekend over at her residence and we had an amazing time. I love getting to sleep next to her and to see her and to talk to her in person.\n\nFor about a week or so now though she has been talking about Valentines day and how stupid she thinks it is. She kept saying it's such a cop out and how she thought it was wrong that people need a day to pretend that they like each other more than they really do. I don't know what I'm doing... she's my first valentine ever and so I thought it might be good if I didn't get her anything because of the way she felt about the holiday.\n\nLast night as I left she ran back to her room and gave me a Valentines day card. I was touched, but I felt really bad for not having anything to give her too. I felt horrible and I apologized , but she just said that it was ok in a monotone voice... and then my taxi pulled up. I tried to make sure she was ok, I didn't want to leave her hurt. She convinced me that she was fine and I finally got into the taxi. On the bus back home she texted me saying that she was actually upset about what I did. I tried to apologize more but I think it just made things worse.\n\nIt's actually Valentines day today, and I could get a bus and do something special for her still, but I don't really know what to do. Should I just give her space? I just want her to know that I love her and that she is special to me.\n\nTL;DR:",

They had planned to get married in May in the Philippines and get everything in motion, with venue reservations etc. already done.\n\nWhen Hurricane Haiyan hit, Houssam had no means of contacting Grace and her family. He faintly heard through a terrible phone connection that something bad had happened, but he did not know how bad nor where she was.\n\nAfter that, he was unable to get any further contact so he decided he had to travel to the Philippines to find her and give her any help he could. He took a leave from work and flew out as soon as he could and found her four days later in an absolutely putrid clinic where she was stitched horribly and not receiving the medical attention she needed. Apparently the roof of their house fell on Grace and did a lot of damage to her, a lot of which went undiagnosed and untreated for four days (not to mention horribly done stitching).\n\nAfter pleading with the coast guard lieutenant in charge, he got assistance to board a boat (as all ticket vendors claimed there were no spots to sell) and got her to a better hospital in Cebu.\n\nHe's spent over $3000 in bills so far and they keep finding new injuries on Grace that require operations.\n\nThis has been very stressful for Houssam and Grace, but also for us as his friends, as we have sent the money we have been able to send but I for one feel very powerless in what I can further do. I'm trying to reach out to the good people on reddit and networks in Facebook but I don't know if it'll be enough.\n\nAny advice on getting more awareness is very much appreciated, sharing and considering even a small donation would be of great assistance.\n\nDevelopments will be posted to\n\nTL;DR:",

I don't have a doubt in my mind about being with him for the rest of my life.  However, lately we have been getting in arguments about silly things, especially when it comes to issues that rise out of jealousy.\n\nEarly in the relationship, he would be jealous about different male friends I talked to and would even show spikes in jealousy about things from my past before we even knew each other.  Over the relationship, he has been able to calm those jealousies down quite a bit.  We came to an understanding on what we think is \"okay\" and \"fair\" between ourselves and friends of the opposite sex.  During this time, I was never *too* jealous over anything and I never have been much of a jealous person in general.\n\nThis would be great if it stayed that way.  Lately though, I find that while his jealousy has all but gone away, mine seems to be rising.  I don't know if it is because we are so close to the wedding, or because I am pregnant.  I know pregnancy hormones are not an excuse to be crazy, but I feel like I am constantly paranoid lately about who he is talking to or texting.  Another slightly important detail is that I have caught him talking to other girls on the internet in our past (which he claims was just innocent or joking).  When I do find myself getting jealous over someone he is talking to, these past incidents always cause a stir in me and I get more jealous or even angry and sad.  I just need to know if someone here has had any similar issues and if it gets better?  Can I chalk it up to pre-wedding / pregnancy hormones or what?\n\nTL;DR:",

I also work 50 hours a week, but we manage to see each other. My issue though is that my boyfriend is very sarcastic and has a very dry sense of humor, and it's become an issue for me. He'll say something that is obviously a joke, but will say it with such sincerity that I actually doubt myself. I've decided that I need to communicate my needs to him- in a relationship, I like to be verbally reminded that my partner cares about me and is proud that we're together. \n\nMy question is, is this normal? All of my friends made fun of me for the way that we started dating- we'd been seeing each other for a few weeks and I asked him about exclusivity. He thought about it for a few days and we decided to begin dating. Everyone tells me that it's weird to do things like that, and that relationships should just fall into place. Is it a red flag that my boyfriend and I are already having issues and it's been less than two months?\n\nTL;DR:",

We were roommates freshman year at University and have stayed friends and continued living together throughout college (we're all seniors now).  A few months ago she started dating a guy seriously (lets call him Greg) and he is at our house a decent amount.  I have fallen madly in love with Greg and I feel terrible about it.  Amy is a very shy quiet girl and extremely introverted like me.  Out of no where one day this guy Greg just came in a swept her off her feet.  He's funny, smart, sweet, attractive, and has the body of a fitness model.  I'm not exaggerating its like he came out of a movie.  A lot of other girls have made comments about him being to good for her which I can sort of understand but I'm no better than her if that makes sense.\n\nSince we share a room I see him shirtless quit a bit and talk to him almost on a daily basis.  I can't ignore him because they spend a lot of time together and obviously I spend a lot of time with her.  Over the last few months I've fallen harder and harder for him.  I tried to resist it at first but I can't anymore and the more I talk to him the more I feel for him and the more feelings I have the more guilty I am.\n\nI should note that I've never expressed these feelings to anyone and have never made a move on him nor him on me.  I honestly just don't know what to do.  I don't want to risk losing my best friend and I would never do anything to separate them.  Amy has never looked even close to this happy in the time that I've known her and they seem great together.  Theres also really no way for me to move out at this point in the year without moving miles off campus which would be impossible since I don't have a car.  What should I do?

The aim of this research was to test whether an 8-week period of exposure to biofeedback training could improve the psychophysiological control over competitive anxiety and enhance athletic performance in participating subjects.', 'Participants of this study were highly competent athletes, each training in different sport disciplines. The experimental group consisted of 18 athletes (4 women, 14 men), whereas the Control group had 21 athletes (4 women, 17 men). All athletes were between 16 and 34 years old. The biofeedback device, Nexus 10, was used to detect and measure the psychophysiological responses of athletes. Athletes from both groups (control and experimental) were subjected to stress tests at the beginning of the study and once again at its conclusion. In between, the experimental group received training in biofeedback techniques. We then calculated the overall percentage of athletes in the experimental group compared with those in the control group who were able to control respiration, skin conductance, heart rate, blood flow amplitude, heart rate variability, and heart respiration coherence. One year following completion of the initial study, we questioned athletes from the experimental group, to determine whether they continued to use these skills and if they could detect any subsequent enhancement in their athletic performance.', 'We demonstrated that a greater number of participants in the experimental group were able to successfully control their psychophysiological parameters, in comparison to their peers in the control group. Significant results (p<0.05) were noted in regulation of GSR following short stress test conditions (p = 0.037), in regulation of HR after exposure to STROOP stressor (p = 0.037), in regulation of GSR following the Math and GSR stressors (p = 0.033, p = 0.409) and in achieving HR - breathing coherence following the math stressor (p = 0.042).']",

I somehow (stupidly!) managed to set my arrive and depart date as June 5th.\n\nSoon as I noticed, the next day, I called Expedia and told them what happened. The guy on the line basically gave me 2 options: Go visit for 3 hours! Or make the changes. I was in a hurry, as I was on lunch at work. After being on hold for over an hour as he spoke to American Airlines, he told me they can't waive the fee because it was my fault. The fee was $360! So now my original ticket went from $460 to $820.\n\nI go back to work and am totally bummed out. I decide that I'll call American Airlines myself in the morning and ask for their help.\n\nAA's service reps and supervisors are sweet as pie to me, and they explain that it's all up to Expedia. I get bounced back and forth between the two companies and wind up speaking to an Expedia supervisor. She is rude and condescending, she talks over me and cuts me off, then when I try to explain to her what happened she puts me on hold for 20 minutes.\n\nShe connects me with a man from head office who is somehow more rude and belittling than she was. I am crying at this point and I tell him I work part time at a coffee shop and I make minimum wage, that I just want to be there for my friend's wedding. He says, \"Well you should have thought about the financial repercussions before accepting the charge.\" And that was it. That's how they helped me.\n\nWhile I totally understand that there are fees and whatnot, and yes - there was a difference in my ticket price ($60!) - but to almost double my fare? What?

In that time, we remained close and talked most of the time. Recently back together, happier than before. The break was good and necessary. We've spent plenty of time together in person. The gap is expected to be closed as of September. Everything is great in general, except for this.\n\nBefore the break-up, he would show a lot of interest in sex talk, and often it'd involved pics. Sometimes a video. I thought it was mutually satisfying. I loved it, and it always came across that he enjoyed it, too. He got really into it. It's a stand-in for us not being able to be intimate in person, you know?\n\nBut now, he's said to me that he has a low interest in it, and I've been trying to subtly pique his interest a few times, but he just flat out ignores it. It makes me feel kind of bad because, I guess it boils down to... why doesn't my boyfriend want to see my boobs anymore? We can't actually have sex or be intimate in person right now, so I thought, just like before, this might help things.\n\nI'm not talking every minute of every day, either. but I want to feel wanted, and I guess I don't right now. I keep wondering, like, why wouldn't he want to see my boobs? I asked him why he was down for it before but not now, and he says he remembered them tapering off before, and that he can only type so many sexy things. He suggested that I use one of my private side-blogs to express all that sexual desire, and that sort of hurt my feelings because what I want is *his* attention and affection and all that. \n\nObviously I'm respecting his preference, and I'm not going to keep pushing for it, but I don't really understand what I'm supposed to do.

Only a few studies have examined the effect of personality traits on survival, such as optimism. The aim of this study was to examine whether an optimistic outlook predicts survival among the oldest-old.', 'The Danish 1905 Cohort Survey is a nationwide, longitudinal survey comprising all individuals born in Denmark in 1905. At baseline in 1998, a total of 2,262 persons aged 92 or 93 agreed to participate in the intake survey. The baseline in-person interview consisted of a comprehensive questionnaire including physical functioning and health, and a question about whether the respondent had an optimistic, neutral or pessimistic outlook on his or her own future.', 'During the follow-up period of 12 years (1998-2010) there were 2,239 deaths (99 %) in the 1905 Cohort Survey.

When confounding factors such as baseline physical and cognitive functioning and disease were taken into account the association between optimism and survival weakened in both sexes, but the general pattern persisted. Optimistic women were still at lower risk of death compared to neutral women [HR 0.85, 95 % CI (0.74-0.97)].

I drive him most places we go if we don't walk. He doesn't like to sleep on sheets so he sleeps on a comfy flannel blanket and underneath another. Here's my issue: He says he doesn't have the time or money or emotional capital to wash his blankets. It's been a month since he's done it last. He lives three blocks away from a laundry mat that's open 24/7 and it's in a beach town so it's always warm year round. I have asked him a few times but he says he doesn't have time and when he comes home from work he doesn't want to go do laundry he wants to relax.\n\nI just got in a fight with him because he said he didn't have time today since he was studying (he had the day off). He says I am being ridiculous and that I need to make a compromise even though I feel like I'm making plenty of compromises never going out on dates (he has no money), never being driven anywhere, never getting gas money, and I always have to bring my own food over to his house cuz he doesn't have any at his. \n\nI'm seriously up to my wits end. I love my boyfriend. He treats me well, he cares, he is thoughtful and we have a blast together and rarely fight. What am I supposed to do? I want to stay at his house and spend the night with him but I'm beginning to feel that if I don't make a damn stand then he will never do it. Would love some advice...\n\nTL;DR:",

        "I started talking to this girl on Facebook, she was part of a meme group I belonged to. I found out that she lived in the same state as me only an hours drive away. We had a lot in common and she was definitely flirting with me and I flirted back. I eventually worked up the courage to ask her on a date,  I don't know why I was so nervous (I knew she'd say yes.) I asked what kind of food she liked and she said sushi or Chinese. I was happy because that is also my favorite type of food. we set the date for the following Wednesday, we chose Wednesday because restaurants tend to be less crowded on a Wednesday after noon, and she has social anxiety. Wednesday came and I got up early and did my daily routine. I showered and dressed in my best casual yet classy clothing, put on my favorite cologne and made sure I had my phone, keys and wallet with cards inside. I called her to let her know I was on my way and would be there around 11 a.m. She was super happy sounding and said she'd be ready. I arrived and knocked on the door and was greeted by her in a beautiful and elegant sundress that made her bright green eyes and auburn hair pop. She was amazing. At the restaurant we were both very quiet, but smiled a lot at each other while stuffing out faces with freshly made sushi and egg rolls. I paid for us both and she offered to leave the tip.",

He is now an ex. I was a senior in HS and he was a freshman in college. But while we were dating he went to jail. I spent my senior year going to visit him and lost out on random events my senior year because of visiting hours. Pretty much I got sucked into a vortex of stupid shit but thought it was \"the best relationship ever\".\n\nAnyways, i went away to college while he was still in jail. I became a raging whore (to say the least). Contracted an STD and ruined my reputation instantly. \n\nAfter a while I met this one guy. He is now my current boyfriend. To sum it up it went like this:\n\nI got blackout drunk and fucked him. Gave him and STD. Lied about having it. Continued to see him. We started dating. Lied about the STD even when a \"friend\" told him about it. Still dated him. Felt little guilt at the time. (In my own defense my doctor said several times I didnt have to tell my partner right away...took it a bit too litterly).\n\nDuring this whole time i lied about something else also. I lied about talking to my ex who when to jail. I missed my old life and used my ex as a way to stay connected with back home while I was in college. So the whole time i was dating my current boyfriend (for the first year we were together) i was talking to my ex. i told him I wasnt in contact. He caught my lying several times and found the proof i was talking to him via texts or facebook\n\nCurrently, i dont talk to him anymore. It took me forever to realize that he was a felon of an asshole and I was obsessed with a nobody. My boyfriend hates me but wont leave me because of A) the STD & B) he says he loves me. Even if these are true he says that he doesn't care anymore, \n\nIs there anyway I can earn back the trust?

I've treated her like gold, except when I caught her lying twice. We both like to party and have fun, and we did. I've grown to really like wine thanks to her. On many days she is drunk by 2 or 3. \n\nWe had decent sex everyday for a couple of weeks.. then she disappeared one night. That night she swears she didn't have sex with her old friend who wrote \"marry me, XOXO\" on her inner thigh. We broke up, she said she wasn't ready for a relationship. I did tease and talked about marriage. Not a good idea, I know.\n\nShe is cute, pretty smart, a very outgoing personality, but not the most honest person. We still hung out a lot afterwords, had sex on occasion. Meanwhile she did spend some time with another ex, met some new guy a few weeks ago, but I think that's over already. She makes me crazy. She even lied about our sex life to a friend of ours, I was bummed. She basically told him 'no way he's too old'. But when things were hot and heavy 5 months ago she shared at the bar how good I was in bed. I don't text or call her but she does contact me almost every day. I am receptive. But I don't want to be. She's like a drug to me.\n\nShe wanted to come over tonight and spoon, she was drunk I was not. I'd have a hard time sleeping.

Need advice\n\nText: I know this might not seem like a massive issue, but it has been bothering me. I (20f) have been on a few pretty casual dates with this guy (20m).  We met in October, but have stayed very platonic until a few weeks ago when he asked me out. \n\nThis sounds really bad, I kind of liked him and thought that I'd be good to give it a go. However, after a couple of dates (one for coffee, another to the cinema) it became apparent that there was no 'chemistry' for me and I did not feel an intellectual connection. I don't really want to take things any further.\n\nMy problem is how best to do this. At the moment conversation has not been at all serious and we have gone no further than hugging. I've had no opportunity to communicate to him that I don't want us to be anything but friends without seeming to make assumptions about his intentions. \n\nHowever, his personality is really sweet and shy. I think from the way he acts around me that he does like me more than a friend and therefore I feel like I'm leading him on by just meeting up with him. What should I do? I could keep 'being busy' when he wants to hang out until he gets the message, but this feels horribly mean. Telling him straight would be awkward and seems to me a little presumptuous and arrogant, seeing as nothing has actually happened..

The five most discriminative features were used to construct receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves and to generate three machine-learning classifiers. Average classification accuracy was determined by cross-validation.', 'Follow-up imaging confirmed sixteen FFT+ and seven FFT- cases. Five shape descriptors delineated FFT+ from FFT- cases.

        "['The \"health workforce\" crisis has led to an increased interest in health professional education, including MPH programs. Recently, it was questioned whether training of mid- to higher level cadres in public health prepared graduates with competencies to strengthen health systems in low- and middle-income countries. Measuring educational impact has been notoriously difficult; therefore, innovative methods for measuring the outcome and impact of MPH programs were sought. Impact was conceptualized as \"impact on workplace\" and \"impact on society,\" which entailed studying how these competencies were enacted and to what effect within the context of the graduates\\' workplaces, as well as on societal health.', 'This is part of a larger six-country mixed method study; in this paper, the focus is on the qualitative findings of two English language programs, one a distance MPH program offered from South Africa, the other a residential program in the Netherlands. Both offer MPH training to students from a diversity of countries. In-depth interviews were conducted with 10 graduates (per program), working in low- and middle-income health systems, their peers, and their supervisors.', \"Impact on the workplace was reported as considerable by graduates and peers as well as supervisors and included changes in management and leadership: promotion to a leadership position as well as expanded or revitalized management roles were reported by many participants. The development of leadership capacity was highly valued amongst many graduates, and this capacity was cited by a number of supervisors and peers. Wider impact in the workplace took the form of introducing workplace innovations such as setting up an AIDS and addiction research center and research involvement; teaching and training, advocacy, and community engagement were other ways in which graduates' influence reached a wider target grouping. Beyond the workplace, an intersectoral approach, national reach through policy advisory roles to Ministries of Health, policy development, and capacity building, was reported. Work conditions and context influenced conduciveness for innovation and the extent to which graduates were able to have effect. Self-selection of graduates and their role in selecting peers and supervisors may have resulted in some bias, some graduates could not be traced, and social acceptability bias may have influenced findings.\"]",

Variables were compared using chi-square tests.', 'All children were skeletally immature. Condylar lesions were medial in 24 knees and lateral in six knees.

I have known people who enjoy the idea of a child, but once they have a child they have no idea on how to raise it.  And when they become older and more conscious of their own opinions towards certain topics the question is \"How was a parent really get through to a child?\"  I have seen so many kids who end up going down a bad path, despite what their parents warn them about or try to help them with, they just won't listen. Even when I was younger I often found myself fighting with my parents about things I thought was right from my point of view, however ended up being very wrong after I experienced it myself.  \n\nOne day I found myself spending a really long time contemplating the idea on how to best approach my children in the future, if I end up having any. So I created a set of videos of myself explaining certain topics directed to my children.  Each topic is roughly centered around different adolescent benchmarks, for example in some videos I discuss what to expect when you first enter High School and what my preconceived notions of High School were, another video discusses bullying, things I wish I would have done in high school, personal mistakes I have made (financially, in relationships, and so on).  The idea behind this was mainly driven by the idea that if I could approach my kids from a younger perspective, that it would have a greater impact on them instead of the old cliche \"When I was your age...\" line.  \n\nNow the question I'm interested in is how do other parents effectively reach their kids and prevent them from making costly mistakes?\n\nTL;DR:",

The increase in the overall incidence (16.0% vs. 2.3%, p = 0.0001) and the actuarial rate of breast cancer among the women in the pregnant group (p = 0.011) was statistically significant. The women treated around the time of pregnancy had a 10- and 15-year actuarial rate of breast cancer of 6.7% and 32.6%, respectively. The 10-year and 15-year actuarial rate for the nonpregnant women was 0.4% and 1.7%, respectively. The median latency from RT to the diagnosis of breast cancer was 13.1 and 18.9 years for women in the pregnant and nonpregnant groups, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, pregnancy around the time of RT was the only variable associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. The risk was dependent on the length of time from pregnancy to RT, with women receiving RT during pregnancy and within 1 month of pregnancy having an increased risk of breast cancer compared with nonpregnant women and women irradiated later than 1 month after pregnancy (hazard ratio, 22.49; 95% confidence interval, 5.56-90.88; p<0.001).']",

I instigated the break up because of all my anxiety due to some mistakes he had made, such as lying to me about going places, not answering his phone and flaking on me, as well as lying about speaking with his ex after I politely asked him to just fill me in if he spoke to her. \n\nSo then, he had his big change-around. Everything got better, he was more open with me, but it still wasn't enough to make up for everything. I started getting bad anxiety both in and out of the relationship. Things between us got toxic and finally blew up with a break up. \n\nI love this guy, and when things are good, they are perfect. The problem is they aren't usually good. I feel like I am fighting for getting all of my needs met, and I just don't feel happy anymore. Right after the break up, he wanted to continue, but take it slowly. So technically, we aren't together, and I only saw him once in the past few weeks since the break up occurred. We have plans tomorrow for our \"first date,\" but all of this feels so stupid now. I don't want to start from square one with someone who I've committed to before he broke up with me. \n\nI just don't know if it is right to be with someone who just doesn't seem to \"get you.\" How much should you have to ask someone to fill your needs? I don't feel I'm asking for too much, I just need more attention than I was getting.\n\nI just need to put things into perspective tonight because I am honestly debating just canceling tomorrow.

We've talked about splitting costs and chores, and have come to some sort of agreement on those (for example, since I make more money than he does, I'll be paying a bit more of the rent, but everything else will be split evenly). One thing that concerns me is the issue of space... I know he's the type who likes his space when we argue, or to just do his own thing, but I feel like that'll be a challenge since we're only looking to rent a 1 bedroom apartment, and we definitely don't want to get on each others nerves!

Absolutely adore each other, love talking about the future together, it makes us excited, etc etc. \n\nLast week she dropped a bomb on me that she thinks she needs a break because she is too dependent on me. To an extent, I understand. We are together an awful lot and maybe need to spend more time with our (separate) friend groups.\n\nThe thing that I don't get is she thinks I am changing who I am for her. She says this because last fall when we first started talking, I was against relationships and was very in to joining a fraternity at the college we both go to. \n\nWhile I am still interested in being a part of a fraternity, my views on relationships obviously has absolutely changed. She has made me want to make her mine, and be exclusive with her. Last fall I did join one, however I didn't complete the pledge process because they got kicked off campus. This means I can join a new one in the fall and I plan on it. I tried explaining to her that this would be good for us because it will force us to not spend so much time together. \n\nI also said it would be good because it will allow her to spend more time with her friends at bars and whatnot, which I can't even go to since I am only 20. The 2 year age difference (sophomore and senior) also seems to make her uneasy at times. But we have been so attached to one another it hardly is ever discussed.\n\nWhile I am fine with taking a break so we can expand socially, I do not want to lose this girl. She tells me she misses me, but still wants the break. I am hoping that a month or two from now she will see that we can be together yet still have our own independent lives.\n\nAny thoughts or advice is appreciated.\n\nTL;DR:",

My friend Kat and I grew up in the same neighborhood and went to school together since we were kids. I've known her my entire life and thought I knew everything about her. We shared secrets, dreams, goals. We were each other's prom date when we couldn't find anyone else. Now we are going to the same college and it's been honestly really great to have someone close by to do things with since it's far from home. \n\nThe problem is that right now my headphones are blasting IYRTITL and trying to drown out the sound of her hooking up with my friend & roommate. It's been going on for the last 3 hours. It's easily the most raunchy things I've ever heard. I feel like I'm in a fucking sitcom where the bed is banging so loudly against the wall it's going to break through. It's worse because he told me he hooked up with this girl all day yesterday and gave me all of the filthy details when were out earlier. Now I realize that this was my closest friend and I can't get the images out of my head. This is probably the reason why she said she was over her exgirlfriend so quickly. OMFG as I am writing this the song is still playing and I can hear her saying she wants him to fuck her harder with his massive cock. I literally can't wrap my head around this so much to process. I texted my girlfriend to see if I could come over but she's already asleep. what the fuck is hapenning, I don't know if I can look at them in the eyes tomorrow\n\nTL;DR:",

I've been with my boyfriend about a year and we live together. Our relationship is great, and we're very open sexually. So about 2 months ago, we had a threesome with some girl. Shortly after that night, I started getting symptoms for an STD and went and got tested by my gynecologist, who is also a family friend of my mom's. I got tested by him because around here you can spend hours upon hours in clinics, whereas with him I'm in and out in a matter of minutes. So anyway, sure enough, I test positive for a very treatable STD. I'm a little annoyed but I don't really think about it too much. But when my doctor came in, he starts telling me that \"this is a time where you find out what your partner is really like\", and then starts lecturing me that I'm with some scumbag asshole. I don't really want to tell him that I had a threesome because he's almost like family to me, but he goes on and on and on about this, super condescendingly, and then keeps pushing me to move out of my place and go back to my parent's. I told him that I knew he didn't cheat on me and I know where this STD stems from, but he just dismissed that and proceeded to lecture me more. \n\nI left the office visibly annoyed but told my bf I tested positive, so he went and got tested as well (at a separate clinic) and got meds for it. My doctor told me that I have to get tested the following month to make sure I'm clear and I'm really dreading this appointment. I feel like doctors aren't allowed to judge me like that and he's making me feel dirty... I don't really want to ditch him and not go to him anymore because it's pretty fucking convenient to have a doctor available whenever you need it.

The primary outcome occurred more frequently in the MACE group than in the non-MACE group (33% vs 24%; P\\xa0=\\xa0.015).

We've been on roughly 5 dates, the last of which being one where she invited me over her apartment for the first time to cook dinner, and ultimately have a PG-13 sleep over. \n\nWe don't text a lot. Mostly to meet up and hang out towards the end of our respective nights and to be flirty during the week in between seeing each other.

There was about 4 guys and they all lasted between 3 and 5 months. Her sighting that she ended things with them because they were either clingy or didn't give her, her space. I'm typically not clingy but it does concern me that she keeps guys around for such a long time without committing. Usually for me 2 months is enough time to know if I want to see someone exclusively or not. \n\nI admit, when I get into something I really get into it, so now I'm a little cautious to let things progress any further knowing that there's a pattern of a time limit looming over my head.

Can I dispute this?\n\nText: I lived in MA with my ex for a year and a half, and originally, we had the electric bill under both of our names. When I moved out in December, I called the company and told them to remove my name, contact info, and payment info from the account and leave his on there. They said they needed him to call, too, so he claimed he did. Today, I was at my parents' house and I got a call from a debt collector at THEIR phone number, which I never provided myself, saying that I owe $150 in past due bills. I managed to log into the account, and found that while his cell number, his SSN, and his email address were on the account, it was under my name and my parents' address. He has been making small payments on the account throughout this time, so I'm sure he did this sometime in the period since I left. My question is, will the electric company drop the charge when I call and explain everything to them on Monday? The debt collector disputed the charge for me, but she seemed to think that I need to contact the police for identity theft even though he wasn't able to use my SSN. Won't the fact that he used his own SSN prove that it wasn't me that set up the account, though? \n\nOr, on the other hand, maybe I should just pay it and close the account. I'm really nervous that he gave them all of my parents' information... he was emotionally abusive towards me and I'm scared that he's just trying to exert control through any avenue he can find. I don't want this to drag out for any length of time, so paying might be the best option. What should I do?\n\nTL;DR:",

I told her how I felt. So our group of friends went to an amusement park together. She said that we were buddies for the day, and on the bus there. The entire day she was lying on me, hugging me, even kissing me on the face occasionally. Non stop. She seemed to try and get us alone on the rides a lot. So later that evening, I told her how I felt. Knowing her on a very deep emotional level helps me understand her more. She said that a lot of times, she sees herself being in a relationship with a few of her guy friends. She told me that all she could think about earlier was us.\n\nShe said that we should take things very slow and start by hanging out and what not. But when I asked her to hang out a couple of times, she seemed to avoid it. Our group of friends goes out a lot, and specifically one of me and her friends is always there. They always laugh, and are close and flirty. I'm not jealous, I'm just wondering why if she said she felt that way and wanted to start somewhere, why she completely ignores me around this guy. \n\nAnother thing is that she tells me or posts about finding the right guy, and I've done everything I can to prove that I only have the world to offer to her. She always says that I'm a nice guy and deserve happiness and what not. \n\nI feel like she is unintentionally leading me on, and she has been a little distant these past few days. She said she didn't want a relationship this summer. I'm confused.\n\nTL;DR:",

It wasn't anything serious, I just thought she was pretty cute. I knew, though, that she had a boyfriend. The class is 99% project oriented, so the few seniors in the class (4 of us, 2f 2m) stuck together and we talked/worked with each other pretty much daily.\n\nFlash forward 3 months (two weeks ago), she was asking my other friend about how to reply to her boyfriends text in a way that would make him mad (the text he sent was the same way), so I assumed they must have broken up. This was a Friday, and the next week us two were assigned to work on a project all week together. I thought this was a perfect opportunity to get closer to her.\nThe whole week we talked and stuff, and nothing major came out of it. I got the sense that she might be interested in me, but Friday of last week, my other friend in the class asked her if she is still dating that one dude (her boyfriend doesn't go to my school), and I strained to hear it but she said something along the lines of yes. I didn't want to believe it but I checked facebook and it said still in a relationship. I felt really uneasy about it, and that week made my feelings for her much stronger. We started texting about school stuff (finals mainly and grades in that class) the last few days, and I really miss her when I am not at school. It's obvious she isn't in a very strong relationship, but I don't want to expect that something bad will happen to what might be a good relationship (in her mind) . I really like her and don't want to stop communicating with her over Christmas break (which started today for me), 3 weeks.\n\nShould I wait her relationship out to see if she's even interested in me? It sucks not having an answer, and it would come across really creepy considering she is still in a relationship (or so I think).

Despite my profuse apologies and worry/nervousness about being the weakest link, he did nothing but support me the entire hike.  He was a plethora of hiking knowledge, gifted me a sweet ultralight homemade cooker/burner, and is letting me use his old trekking poles to see if they're comfortable/something I want to purchase.\n\nAwesome hike, awesome guy.\n\nThanks for everything, Mike!!!

        "Sam's granddad was going to take Sam and his two brothers, James and Evan on vacation.  They could choose to go to the lake or the beach.  If they chose the lake, they would get to go on their granddad's boat.  If they chose the beach, there would be sand to dig in.  All three boys began to clap and cheer for the beach!  The boys left their house in their granddad's van to drive to the beach.  They drove by their school on the way.  The boys were glad to be out for the summer.  On the road, the boys played a game.  Whoever counted the most big trucks would be the winner.  James counted one hundred and five trucks.  This was more than Sam or Evan counted.  Evan pointed out the window at a man dressed all in black riding a black motorcycle.  The man had a long beard.  When they got to the beach, their granddad told them to put on sunscreen so they would not get sun burned. The boys grabbed their pails and shovels and ran down on to the sand near the water.  Their granddad brought a chair to sit on and a large umbrella to give him shade.  He also brought some noodles for the boys to float on if they went into the water.  Sam found a piece of wood washed up on the beach.  He used it make a bridge over large hole that the boys had dug.",

This is a place that has been operational for some time and I have purchased from several times in the past. I purchased the items online as they are out of state.\nAfter not receiving the items for over a week I checked to see if I had been charged, which I had. When I checked my order status online it said it was processing, so I sent them an email asking for the order status- no response. I had a busy week, so I didn't think about it until a week later. Sent another email- no response.\nThis is when I attempted to call them and I found all their phones have been disconnected. I did some googling at this point and found that the store had closed sometime around the time I made the order. Evidently loads of people were ripped off and there are several news articles about it.\nThe thing is, their web site is still functional. You can still go there and buy something, and presumably never get it. This feels like blatant fraud/theft to me.\nSo my question is, is there anything I can do to secure a refund or at least make sure this person doesn't get away with this? Is this criminal or civil? I have already filed a complaint with the BBB. The purchase was less than $100, so not worth hiring a lawyer...\n\nTL;DR:",

Between January and August 2008, the eighth follow-up of the cohort was conducted. All the individuals of the original cohort who were alive (who were then adolescents aged between 14 and 15 years) were targets for the study. The International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) questionnaire was used to define wheezing. In addition to the body mass index (BMI), used to define obesity by the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria, we assessed skinfold thickness.', 'From the original cohort, 4,349 individuals were located (85.7% follow-up rate). The prevalence of chest wheezing at 11 and 15 years were 13.5% (95% CI: 12.5%-14.5%) and 12.1% (95% CI: 11.1%-13.1%), respectively. The prevalence of wheezing at both times was 4.5% (95% CI: 3.9%-5.1%) and the incidence of wheezing was 7.5% (95% CI: 6.7%-8.3%). Independent of the effect of various confounding variables, the prevalence of wheezing at 15 years was 50% greater among obese individuals than among eutrophic individuals at 11 years (RR 1.53; 95% CI: 1.14-2.05). The greater the skinfold tertile at 11 years, the higher the prevalence of wheezing at 15 years was (p = .011). Weight status and skinfolds did not present any association with incident wheezing.

One of her classmates seems to have taken that role, as she spends a good deal of time with him (I actually do not have any concern there's anything sexual going on there. He's a great guy and I'm really glad he's there for her if it's not me), but this is upsetting, since I feel like there's a gap growing between us.\nRecently an old friend - who isn't exceptionally trustworthy when it comes to this relationship - told me that he saw her profile on tinder. This worries me, since she's never mentioned tinder and definitely did not have access to it the first two-ish years of our dating.\nWe've been distant sexually, which has been attributed to her heavy course load and projects - a similar case came up when I was going through the same, so I never thought it was something to worry about.\nI worry that there's actually something that she thinks is missing, and, instead of wanting to talk to me about it, is confiding in someone who may be encouraging her to explore these other options without telling me. It's really hard for me because I don't know how to broach this issue without seeming either crazy or like I'm stalking her in some way (she's very protective of her phone so I 1-would never go through her stuff without her knowing and 2-would not have a chance to off-handedly notice her sending tinder whatevers [I guess it's bad that I don't even know how Tinder UI works]).\nIf there's something wrong I want to be able to really address it, find a solution, and work towards it together.\nI really don't want to bring up something crazy and potentially nonsensical as she's already recovering from a super stressful semester, but there's a building anxiety that I am having a hard time dealing with.\n\nTL;DR:",

His security job only nets him about 1200 a month.

We were originally staying with his mother but things fell apart with her husband being really violent/anger problems and we were kicked out and forced to stay in a hotel for a week before we could find a place to take us. \n\nHis grandmother paid for the first two months of our rent here because it should have only taken two months for us to both get jobs.

Now, we're seeing eachother again. \n\nShe doesn't want to make it fb official until everything is right. Weve been together since I was 20 and she was 17. I love this girl. I thought I knew what I wanted when I made my decision to leave her. But now we are seeing eachother again and I know that if I don't do this right, I'll regret it for the rest of my life. I love this girl unconditionally and I know she cares for me back. \n\nMy question is, I think, is if I'm just crazy? I know I'm young and that I'm in a sea of cock hungry women and all that but I don't want to just throw the D around. I want a relationship that means something. I believe this girl is the one. We have so much fun, we laugh a lot, she thinks I'm great. But she is hesitant to make it official. I would like to blow her away and I'm treating the whole being official thing as though I am kind of proposing. Like I want to come up with a diamond necklace and make a fancy box and everything. \n\nThis is a throwaway, but it's my first post, and I'm waiting to go to work. I would love to hear thoughts or anything. Ideas on what I shoul do? Any females that know kind of what this is like?\n\nShe's with a friend right now, and won't communicate at all when she's with this friend because she doesn't like me.  That's a whole other issue, how do I handle the friends who think I'm a jackass? \n\nI appreciate any feedback, I'd love to hear anyone's opinion. If needed, I can provide more information.\n\nTL;DR:",

        "Hello All. I am adding as little personal info as possible, but still trying to give you the facts so that I can get good advice on what to do next. My husband and I were married last year (2014) and had a small(ish) wedding but in a different state than where we live. We spent quite a bit going back and forth to get all the logistics perfect. Then, after the wedding, we skipped a honeymoon and spent that time with my grandfather, who was dying of lung cancer (he passed 2 months after our wedding). Then, a few months after that, we learned that my very rare brain tumor came back and I was going to have to have another surgery. Fast forward to Feb and I had to take 2 months off my new job (had been there 6 months) in order to have this surgery and recover. My recovery has been slower than I thought and going back to work has been difficult. My husband is a waiter at a high end restaurant and is now looking for work at an office building (he has previous experience as a runner on a trading floor) but has been out of the office environment for over 6 years so no one will look at his resume seriously. He is trying to find a job that has insurance so that I can quit or go to part time work because the recovery has been so difficult. \nI feel like I am stuck being miserable at work (brain surgery recovery is no joke) or quitting and having no insurance and no dependable income - which is needed for all this debt that we accrued (for the wedding, pre-surgery and then all the doctor's / hospital bills post surgery). Am I stuck? Are we stuck? My student loan debt alone make up half of our monthly income. My dream would be to leave the corporate world and make money from home somehow...but is that reasonable? And is that fair to my husband?",

I like to keep a stock of food in my apartment, and also have a stash of junk food. My boyfriend does not keep much food in his apartment. We stay at each other's places alternate weekends. It's not possible for me to go to his every weekend. \n\nWhen I stay at his, I have to buy food for myself. Generally we will buy food to cook together, but if I want anything extra to eat then I have to buy it. Think like snacks etc. Most times he will then eat some of what I've bought. When he stays at mine, he eats whatever is there. He will just open my fridge/cupboard and eat what he wants. He never pays me for what he takes and never replaces it and I have told him about this several times but he does not stop.\n\nThere is a particular type of candy bar I really like. I bought a multipack of them last week and didn't eat any. I went to the cupboard yesterday to get one and there were none left. He'd eaten them all over the weekend. He didn't even ask me if he could have any. In fact, he doesn't like them! He has complained in the past about me buying them because he doesn't like them. I'm buying them for me, not him. I actually made him go out then and there (he was in bed) and buy me replacements.\n\nI don't know what to do. I've spoken to him about it before and I got pretty mad yesterday and told him that he was rude and selfish. Even if he was welcome to eat them, that he should have actually thought about me and left some for me, but he didn't. I'm really angry actually. Am I over-reacting? Should I ban him from taking anything from my kitchen? Or should I make him bring his own food? It's not just the cost, it's the fact that these are things I want, and now they're gone. A final thing to note is: he bought something for himself a couple of weeks ago, and he hid it in my cupboard so I couldn't find it and wouldn't eat it.\n\nTL;DR:",

I have a 6m old kelpie, buzz, who goes with me daily to a dog park, where we meet with the same off-leash group of 20ish dogs/owners. He's not aggressive at all, but can be a little rough, like biting neck skin or whapping his paws on other dogs backs. Most of the other dogs there are really tolerant but I'm hoping he will learn through play when enough is enough.\n\nA new dog (8m shephad/retriever) has been coming with his owner the last few days, the first day they came buzz took a liking to this new dog, max, and was all over him. Max was playing back, not submissive or anything but the owner stepped in and hauled buzz off and whacked him. \n\nThe owner was informed by myself and other owners at the park that was NOT OK, and was reassured that everyone will step in if things do get aggro. \n\nToday buzz was at it again and max was giving as good as he got, but the owner was continuously staring daggers at me and lunging at buzz/pulling his collar roughly. I put buzz on the leash for a little bit to give max and owner some space, but let him off again later, only for the same scenario to repeat. \n\nI need advice on how to handle this tomorrow, I don't think it's fair for buzz to be on the leash for playing. Its a loop style park and we all just walk around the track under the trees, the dogs follow along. \n\nAs a side note, max tumbled buzz onto the gravel today and gave him a bleeding nose, but like I said, its very obvious its just play/accidental I'd just like the other owner to realise that too.\n\nTL;DR:",

Starting rows and screaming at me for trivial things etc. This is something I'd never experienced before. It then calmed down for a short time but it returned but not to that extent, I started fighting back (not physically) and developed a serious anger/rage issue because of not knowing how to deal with it. \n\nThe relationship continued like this with really good times and even worse times, then about 16 months ago I started getting anxious, then depressed and having panic attacks. I blamed work for it, (even though it was never a problem previously) and went to counselling and took a course of anti-depressants(lexapro) up until recently. I've essentially realised the last number of months that the relationship is the problem, and of the last week decided I cannot work on it any longer and it needs to end before I get worse and relapse. \n\nI've probably painted and angel of myself and a devil of the other , but I've done and said some things I'm not proud of.

I could really use some advice?\n\nText: We have been together for less than a year, we started living together after around 3 months, and I love her very, very much. Like \"she could be the one\" material here.\n\nHowever since around 4 months ago now, she hasn't been feeling sexy. I on the other hand have been leaking at the seams with hornyness. \n\nWe've disscussed it three times now. The first two times she didn't really open up, understanderbly...its personal! But I talked to her again about it last night and she revealed that she has a lot to think about in her life and sex doesn't really seem important.\n\nI told her it is important for me, as dry spells lasting upwards of 2 weeks leave me horney as hell, and just being rejected all the time sends me straight to the shower for a \"personal pick me up ;)\". I told her all this and she confided that she also masterbates maybe once every 3 days. I said that if this happens on a regular basis that we both just go off and masterbate solo...I can see the passion dieing, and its passion for me that underlines everything.\n\nSorry for the uber long rant, what I'm really looking for is peoples opinions on whether this is normal, what you think I can do to rekindle this still young flame of a relationship, and as a bonus, what are some ways I can help her take her mind of the important things, if only for 30 minutes...\n\nTHE FACTS: she's a student, chinese, living in uk on student visa, studying her m.a, wants to study phd. I'm an aspiring designer working in IT currently. She said its not me, she doesnt feel sexy AT ALL. for anyone.\n\nTL;DR:",

Ever Since we started living together, i saw some dark sides of his behavior, we talked about it, and tried to work it out and vice versa.

I don't match his definition of compatibility, so we decided to end this relationship. \n\nNow, I had left my job and moved to US with him on a dependent visa (since 2 years). I had used up all my savings on the wedding as at that time, my husband was a student and couldn't have afforded to share the costs. So, now I am broke, my marriage is over, I am still on a dependent visa here, and I don't want to go back home to my parents paying for me. \n\nMy parents love my husband, I never discussed any of the negative things about him so they think of him like some godsend husband for their daughter. My mom has a heart condition, and she'll literally die if I tell her that I want a divorce. \n\nI have asked my husband to just pay me whatever my last salary was, for the number of months i've not been working.

In this study, parotid function was assessed in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancers undergoing intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with or without chemotherapy. Parotid function was assessed with the help of a questionnaire and parotid scintigraphy, especially with regards to unilateral sparing of the parotid gland.', 'In total, 19 patients were treated with compensator-based IMRT between February 2003 and March 2004. The dose to the clinical target volume ranged between 66 and 70 Gy in 30-35 fractions to 95% of the isodose volume. Ipsilateral high-risk neck nodes received an average dose of 60 Gy and the contralateral low-risk neck received a dose of 54-56 Gy. Eight of 19 patients also received concomitant chemotherapy.', 'Subjective toxicity to the parotid glands was assessed with the help of a questionnaire at 0, 3 and 6 months and objective toxicity was assessed with parotid scintigraphy at 0 and 3 months.

At a median follow-up of 13 months, 9/19 patients had no symptoms of dryness of the mouth (grade I), 8/19 had mild dryness of the mouth (grade II) and only 2/19 had grade III xerostomia, although the parotid gland could only be spared on one side in most of the patients.']",

I figured it was just something casual, as we hadn't really ever talked much except for the 5 days leading up to when we actually met up, and even then it was only over facebook. It wasn't all that great of an experience (for me at least) and I didn't plan on pursuing a relationship with her, but I suppose she had other plans. She told me afterwards that she had feelings for me, so I told her that perhaps it's best that we don't continue to mess around as its not really fair to her seeing as I don't feel the same way. She went on for a bit about how I was \"fucking her over\", I apologized, and I figured that that would be the end of it. I was wrong. She kept messaging me, so I never responded hoping she would get the message (pretty immature in retrospect but oh well). She hasn't messaged me in a week or so, but she's been trying to get my friends to invite her over when we hang out and has apparently also been telling a bunch of mutual acquaintances that she's pretty much \"one of the guys\" (She's hung out with me and a buddy of mine once for perhaps an hour, if that). I also found out a little bit later through the grapevine that she took pictures of me with her phone without me knowing. I tried to be nice and apologetic about the whole thing, idk if I sent the right message or what, but she's still lurking around and bugging my friends and its kind of creeping me out now. Am I in the wrong here? What the hell do I do?\n\nTL;DR:",

Re: older guy who's highly accomplished in my field.\n\nText: I'm a young lawyer. A couple of months ago, I and another female coworker were sent to an out-of-town assignment. We were joined in by a partner of an international firm; we'll call him \"John.\" John is single, maybe in his late 40s, and as mentioned, highly accomplished in his field. Notwithstanding, this guy is incredibly down-to-earth and we ended up getting along really well, as if we've been old friends.

Being incredibly intelligent and having lived all over the world, this guy blew my mind. He's so intellectually stimulating but at the same time, we laugh at the same stupid jokes, and I think these two things are what made me attracted to him. Nothing physical happened during the trip, though.\n\nFast forward to today, when we're both back to our respective cities, we're still exchanging e-mails: what's happening in our lives lately, photos, jokes, etc. I like him for sure, but I'm not entirely certain if he likes me back or if he's just being friendly.\n\nApart from the he-likes-me-he-likes-me-not guessing game, I'm also brooding about how John is in the position of giving me the opportunity of joining his firm. That'll be huge for me. The thing is, I'm not shabby looking. It's very easy for male clients and other people I work with to fall for me. On several occasions, I admittedly attempted to use my charms and be flirty to possibly gain career advantages, but all those attempts ended with me falling flat on my face. With John, I have no intentions of flirting with him just to land a job in his firm, both because (1) I know it won't work; and (2) I'm sincerely into this guy.\n\nIn conclusion, please, please, please lend me your insights on how I could get the man and get the job at the same time.\n\nTL;DR:",

After 3 years of frustrating myself under the impression that I had the passion for visual art I quit school and decided to move on, inspired by a then-freshly developing relationship with a young lady.  I had a few friends at school but lost touch with them as they either left the city or our common interest dissolved.  Since then I had taken up a 9-5 and spent my time devoted to writing music/selling records/mp3s and the aforementioned young lady.  At the time I was feeling pretty satisfied and didn't really see a need to socialize outside of that. It was a pretty intimate relationship that I took seriously and to this day I'm lost to understand how things went so awry.  After about a year she decided our romantic interests no longer met and that we should just be friends, a strategy that has not been copacetic.\n\nDismantled, I struggled to focus my energy on my hobby with some success.  I did an album, I toured internationally, I rubbed shoulders with some pretty high level people in that scene. Made a few friends but they live far away and are quite busy themselves.  Music industries are exploitative, oversaturated, and ruthlessly commercial and that has left me with some doubt about continuing.  Over the course of the last two years my inspiration has waned and now I'm left feeling pretty dead and empty now that I no longer have that hobby to distract me.\n\nI've not had much chance to make friends or meet people I connect with over that time, and every friend I've had made has grown apart from me.  I go out semi regularly and socialize but rarely connect with anyone, so far never enough to sustain a friendship or romance. I feel somewhat crippled by the vaccumn of intimacy and social support left by the end of my last serious relationship. After all this time I'm only barely aware of my own personal identity in a social context to even know where to go to meet people with things in common - Reddit included. I'm introverted but not anti-social, and right now I'm at the nadir of a two year rut, and feeling especially lost\n\nTL;DR:",

I'm madly in love with this girl and last night we were talking at her place about the whole situation and she said she has so many thoughts running through her mind so she doesn't know what to do in this exact moment, but hinted at breaking this off so I don't get hurt more than I already am. It's not over...yet but my heart tells me to hold on until the bitter end even though I know for a fact then if she does indeed leave, I'm going to be forever hurt and in pain. It doesn't help that I'm already battling depression and anxiety. I'm in so much pain right now and it's not even officially done yet, my heart can't take this. I've even thought of extreme situations where I would offer to move to NV with her. I don't have the heart to convince her to stay because she is VERY family oriented and at the end of the day, who the fuck am I to tell her anything, really? Please help. I'm sad.\n\nTL;DR:",

        "So, my husband and I have been together for 5 years as of next week. We have a 4 year old daughter together. I love him (well, I think so), but our relationship isn't super healthy (I'm super introverted and he thinks it's fun to make me uncomfortable/anxious, he doesn't take 'no' for an answer, etc). I'm constantly second-guessing our relationship. We got married and started our family young, so I feel like I'm constantly wondering \"what if\" - what if we hadn't gotten married, what if we didn't have kids right away, what if it was all a huge mistake. \n\nAnyway, enter the ex. We \"dated\" in middle school and hooked up a couple times throughout high school. I never felt so passionate about anyone. We didn't have the greatest relationship either - very off and on - but I deeply, deeply loved him. So now he keeps popping up in my thoughts...\n\nHere's the kicker: he's got a daughter of his own, although I just recently found out he had split with the girl's mother after she broke off their engagement. So now I have this urge to reach out to him - to see if there's still something between us. \n\nI never wanted to be \"that girl\" - the one who gets married and pregnant too young, the one that ends up divorced.

Our objectives were to investigate whether first-trimester FA use protects against heart anomalies among DS children.', 'Women with liveborn DS children participating in the Slone Epidemiology Center Birth Defects Study between 1976 and 1997 were included. We performed case-control analyses using DS, with heart anomalies as cases and DS, without heart anomalies as controls. Subanalyses were performed for defects that have been associated with FA in non-DS populations (conotruncal, ventricular septal [VSD]) and for those that are associated with DS (ostium secundum type atrial septal defects [ASD]and endocardial cushion defects [ECD]). Exposure was defined as the use of any FA-containing product for an average of at least 4 days per week during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, whereas no exposure was defined as no use of FA in these 12 weeks.', 'Of the 223 cases, 110 (49%) were exposed versus 84 (46%) of the 184 controls.

PD on the visual analog scale (VAS) was assessed during a methacholine-induced FEV(1) decrease and specifically was quantified as the VAS slope and score at an FEV(1) decrease of 5 to 20%. BHR was assessed in terms of the provocative concentration of methacholine causing a 20% fall in FEV(1) (PC(20)). Eosinophil counts in induced sputum samples also were performed. Regression analysis, univariate analysis of variance, and factor analysis were applied for statistical evaluation.', 'For a 5 to 20% fall in FEV(1) from the lowest point after saline solution induction, VAS score was lowest in group II, slightly higher in group I, slightly higher still in group IV, and the highest in group III. In the patients as a whole, BHR related to PD, but age, clinical score, duration of the disease, and presence of baseline airway obstruction did not. In patients with obstruction who were treated with ICSs, eosinophil counts related to PD negatively. Factor analysis yielded the following four factors that accounted for 70% of the variance in the data: ICS; eosinophil counts; FEV(1); and PC(20) loaded on separated factors with PD loading on the same factors as PC(20). The post hoc analysis carried out dividing the patients into ICS-treated and ICS-naive, showed that in the former group eosinophil counts and BHR proved to be factors negatively associated with PD, while in the latter group eosinophil counts were positively associated with PD.']",

A comparison of PTS between the two groups was performed.\", 'The overall failure rate of the present study was 8.4%. Of the 40 participants, the mean medial PTS was 4.1° ± 3.2° and the mean lateral PTS was 4.6° ± 2.6°.

Anyways to the fuck up.\n\nSo I'm sitting down during the Homily (When the Priest tells you what to do/not do) and it's very quiet. And I have this perfect line of sight on the her. I turned to look at her, and I noticed she turned away when I turned to look at her. I'm all excited because I just caught her checking me out. So my thought process was **Lets stare at her until she turns back around**.\n\nSo about a minute later she turns around and looks at me, on impulse I think it would be a smart idea to wink at her. Right after I did, she smiled and winked back. It was here that I proceed to make a noise that only chipmunks and high pitched baby girls should be capable of making.  I was the 4th brother in Alvin in the Chipmunks and everyone was very aware of the noise. The church is fairly large so the noise echoed throughout the church in all directions. The Priest actually paused after I made the noise and looked around slightly. Everyone sitting near knew it was me and I curled into a ball and try to remain invisible for the remaining portion of mass. Blonde girl thought it was funny however not sure how to proceed after that.\n\nTL;DR:",

At times he says and does things that myself and everyone around me can tell show he likes me, but other times we act completely platonic.

We've been together for six years now, and knowing that we share a lot of differences in our political beliefs, we've completely avoided talking about them. \n\nA lot of my friends are members of the LGBTQIA community, and my best friend is a trans woman. My boyfriend likes her a lot, always asking me when she's coming over next because he misses her, but he is disturbed by her lifestyle. He says he can't be with someone who supports a \"leftist agenda\" and I'm heartbroken. We've been together for six years and I feel like my only options are to\n\n A. Never bring up political issues and live in ignorant bliss \nB. Be honest, and watch the man I love leave me\n\nOther than this we have a perfect relationship. I guess I've been with him, introducing him to my friends and hoping he'll see how wonderful they are and will change his mind. As it is he's warmed up to them but he still admits to thinking homosexuality and the like is wrong. \n\nTo clarify: he doesn't hate LGBTQIA members and isn't a gun-toting tea party member, he was raised in a religious home and just believes it's a lifestyle of sin (yes that's not a good thing but he isn't an \"evil person\") and he won't approve of it.\n\nHe refuses to attend my best friend's wedding and to be honest this really embarrasses me. I don't want to be \"that girl who's engaged to the bigot,\" or to ever be in a situation where I would have to choose between my friends and my boyfriend. \n\nIs there any way at all I can help him to see differently, or is our relationship bound for failure?

I knew nothing about introducing dogs and did everything wrong. The first thing I remember was she came in and peed on Sadie (our first dog 3yrs) bed. She was sick so we coddled her, and she pushed around Sadie when she got better. \n\nNow I fear she is trying to become the leader, I've been training her since I got her. She knows all her basics, but on walks she tries to lead, she has never walked behind me and barely walks beside me on a good day. And now that she's older and bigger she overpowers Sadie in everything. If Sadie is walk-in ahead of her she will cut Sadie off or try to get in front of her, when I'm petting Sadie or calling her, she will sit in front of Sadie and sometimes sits on her. I push loki away and she pushes back. I ignore her and she whines. Its very frustrating because she is a big dog (boarder collie/pit) and Sadie is smaller (shih tzu/terrier), and especially on walks its gotten worse. Sadie ( who was never trained until I started about 6 months ago) is aggressive towards other dogs on the walk, which brings Loki into a frenzy. Which is bad because when Loki sees a dog she pulls and freaks out trying to greet them. Together its a shit show. I try to get them to sit and be calm, but its like the three stooges. I calm one down. The other gets up and freaks out. Any advice?\n\nTL;DR:",

Many of them are models and/or instagram famous, and sleep with professional athletes and famous musicians. Unlike most of my sisters, I am a 6/10, maybe 7 if I'm being generous. I'm not even sure why my sorority wanted me, as a lot of sororities choose people based heavily on looks (yes, it's true), especially at schools where Greek life is a big deal. As a side note, I love my sisters and don't resent them for being beautiful. They are not just good-looking, most of them are also nice, smart, and fun.\n\nMy boyfriend [24M] of one year has always had a wandering eye. Whenever we hang out around a hot girl he's never met before, I catch him stalking her Facebook profile for weeks after, usually while in the bathroom or at weird hours of the night. I don't know for sure that he's masturbating to their pictures but it certainly looks that way. I have no problem with porn and watch it myself, but masturbating to people's Facebook profiles just seems too... personal. It makes me feel horrible about myself and I feel like he's just settling for me (he doesn't have great skills with the females- I actually picked him up when we first met).\n\nHe's a member of a frat so there are a lot of date events I want to take him to, but I'm afraid to hang out with him around such hot girls for fear that he'll develop another infatuation. \n\nPlease don't berate me, I know my self-esteem is very low, and I know I'm the problem, not him. I'm looking for advice on how to get over it and feel comfortable taking him to my sorority events. If someone has dealt with similar issues I would also like to hear your story and how it panned out.\n\nThanks!\n\nTL;DR:",

It also looks like it will be long distance for the foreseeable future, as we go to different universities. However things are going really well, we love each other, we see each other as regularly as possible and when we do we have a lot of fun together. It is honestly the best relationship I've ever been in.\n\nSo onto the problem, due to our relationship being long distance, we don't progress as fast relative to normal relationships, which I am completely fine with. I have met the family (who are all lovely btw), but I haven't met his friends. The thing is that, the majority of his friends are female and he is friends with all of his exes, which is also perfectly fine as I have male friends too, and I completely support friendships with people of the opposite sex. His best friend is also female, who talks really highly of (of course), but she is so pretty and ridiculously smart, and sometimes I feel like I can't compete, even though I know it's not a competition. There's also an irrational part of me that gets jealous every time he talks about one of his female friends, particularly when it's a one on one meet up. I know he loves me very much and would never cheat on me (however he did once say that the only time he would ever cheat on me would be if he was extremely drunk, wtf?). I never show my jealously to him, but it's always lingering at the back of my mind and I get paranoid when he doesn't text me all night. I really don't want to become an possessive, clingy girlfriend, but I fear I may. I know that this problem is mainly my own insecurity, as my boyfriend does a good job on reassuring me, and we text several times a day. How do I stop being jealous? I really don't want to push him away. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!\n\nTL;DR:",

She's intelligent, caring, kind, practical, selfless, and beautiful (more on that to come).\n\nHowever, as much as I love her, she's been putting on a visible amount of weight, and doesn't seem concerned about trying to lose it or even slow down her weight gain.

I'm especially worried that if we get married, she'll have no incentive to attempt to remain attractive to me at all. \n\nSome other details: I'm extremely health and fitness oriented. I lift weights at least 5 times per week, and do cardio in the mornings about 2-4 times per week. I watch what I eat to the point where I count calories and macronutrients when cutting weight. Beyond that, she's much less concerned with physical aesthetics than I am. While I think she appreciates that I'm in objectively good shape, it's really not that important to her. I'll also say that her sex drive is much much lower than mine, which we're working through. \n\nI've attempted time and time again to guide her in fitness and nutrition, offering to write her workout plans and trying o show her why it's not a good idea to eat so many prepackaged processed foods and desserts, but it's just really not important to her so she mostly brushes it off. \n\nHow can I show her my feelings and concerns without hurting her?\n\nTL;DR:",

Remission is defined as biochemical reversal of hypercortisolism with re-emergence of diurnal circadian rhythm, resolution of clinical features and adequate suppression on low-dose dexamethasone testing. Failure is defined as the absence of any of these features. Relapse is defined as the re-emergence of Cushing's disease more than one year after operation. Clinical features such as weight, sex, hypertension, associated endocrine disorders and smoking, biochemical studies including preoperative and postoperative serum cortisol, urine free cortisol, serum ACTH, radiological, histological and surgical findings were assessed in relation to these three groups to determine whether any factors could reliably predict failure or relapse after treatment.\", 'Of the 61 patients included in this study, 48 (78.7%) achieved initial remission and 13 (21.3%) failed treatment. Seven patients suffered subsequent relapse (range 22-158 months) in their condition after apparent remission, leaving a final group of 41 patients (67.2%) in the remission group. Tumour was identified at surgery in 52 patients, of whom 38 achieved remission. In comparison, only 3 of 9 patients in whom no tumour was identified achieved remission. This difference was significant (P = 0.048). When both radiological and histological findings were positive, the likelihood of achieving remission was significantly higher than if both modalities were negative (P = 0.038). There were significant differences between remission and failure groups when 2- and 6-week postoperative serum cortisol levels (P = 0.002 and 0.001, respectively) and 6-week postoperative urine free cortisol levels (P = 0.026) were compared. This allowed identification of patients who failed surgical treatment in the early postoperative period. Complications of surgery included transitory DI in 13, transitory CSF leak in 8 and transitory nasal discharge and cacosmia in 3.

        "So for background, this is one of my friend's girlfriend's sisters, and we met at a party about a year ago. She wanted to date then, but I wasn't ready. FFWD to now and we have been together for the entirety of this last semester (we go to the same college). This is also the first relationship I've been in since high school, and she's been in and out of them for quite a while.\n\nAbout an hour ago she texted me saying that everything hit her at once, and that she was crying. I asked why, thinking it would be trivial or a dream she had. I receive a very thought out speech about how her mental health isn't where it needs to be, and being in a relationship is only making it worse. She also said things like relationships can only end in one way when we're this young, so what's the point of having them. She told me she needs to find herself before she can love someone else. \n\nI've heard things like this before from her, but it was never this serious. She is seeking help for her mental health, before people ask, but she said she doesn't want to slow me down or drag me into it. We exchanged saying I love you about a week and a half ago, and I've told her plenty of times that I am willing to do what it takes to be with her, but she was not having it.\n\nI ultimately decided that if she's this distraught about it, that it would actually be best to let her go, and not try and convince her to stay since it may just become worse. \n\nDid I do the right thing in letting her go, or should I have tried to be more understanding and appeal to her feelings?",

The assassination will be risky, with Frankie being warned by a fellow enforcer that should he be spotted before the hit is performed, the contract will be reneged. First he follows his target to select the best possible location, but opts to wait until Troiano isn't being accompanied by his bodyguards. Next, he goes to purchase a revolver from Big Ralph, an obese gun runner who keeps sewer rats as pets. The encounter with this old acquaintance leaves Frankie feeling disgusted. With several hours left before the hit is to be performed, Frankie decides to kill time in the city, where he is plagued by memories of past trauma during his time living there. While sitting alone for a drink, Frankie is reunited with childhood friend Petey, who invites the reluctant Frankie to a Christmas party, where Frankie later encounters his old flame, Lori. The following day Frankie goes to see Lori at her apartment to get better reacquainted with her, but the visit ends in disaster when an at first vulnerable Frankie suddenly attempts to sexually assault her. Lori forgives Frankie for his actions and calmly asks him to leave, to which he obliges. That same day, Frankie tails Troiano and his mistress to a Jazz club in Greenwich village. However, he is spotted by Big Ralph, who decides to blackmail Frankie out of the hit. In turn, Frankie stalks Ralph back to his tenement and strangles him to death following a violent brawl between the two. Losing his nerve, Frankie calls up his employers to tell them he wants to quit the job. Unsympathetic, the supervisor tells him he has until New Year's Eve to perform the hit.",

He'd been undergoing a long depression of his own at the time, and those two scenarios combined makes not a pretty situation.\n\nAnyway, I moved to be with him, and shortly after that, we broke up. I've been in no contact with him for the last seven months, but I still think about him every day. I'm happy with where I live now: I have a job I love, an apartment I love, and tons of friends in this city (where I'd lived before we met, so). But part of me still can't shake off the fact that I moved here because of him, and that we now live about 10 miles away from each other, when most of our arguments were based on the distance in our relationship. And then there's the fact that we have a ton of mutual friends, including my current roommate, so I can't seem to escape him coming up in a conversation way more frequently than I'd like.\n\nI know a lot of what I'm supposed to do—continue NC, date other people, make it known to my mutual friends that I do NOT want to talk about him—so primarily the reason I'm posting this here is for support, guys. I don't want to talk to my friends about this because I don't want to tire them, so I'm just posting it here, so that it's off my chest somewhat.\n\nThanks for reading, if you did.\n\nTL;DR:",

They say that they would support me in any decision I make, but then every single day they pull me aside and tell me that I shouldn't do it because of the little money. They say I would be wasting my potential that God has given me. I love my family, but I really feel like teaching is something I am supposed to do. All my teachers and students say I would be an excellent teacher! How can I politely tell my family that this is something I am going to pursue regardless of what they say?

I'm having a tough time overcoming thoughts from her past sexual experience.\n\nText: So as you can tell from the title, I'm relatively new to sexual experience which means everything that I'm taking part in with my girlfriend is brand new to me and absolutely great. I'm happy that she's open about her past and willing to answer questions that I have in regards to sex and is also very open to trying new things with me as I learn more and more.\n\nHere's where the issue arises. This probably sounds very silly but I can't help feel jealous that basically anything I've ever suggested to her she's already had experience with. What compounds the problem is that she's only ever been with one other guy in her lifetime.\n\nThis is going to sound incredibly silly but I can't help relate the way I feel to that simple saying that goes along the lines of medal standings in the Olympics. Everyone wants to be win first place and get the gold medal, it's the highest honours after all. Getting second place though means you were just that close to first but not quite good enough. Meanwhile most people that achieve the bronze are happy with their position. I almost feel like I'd be more comfortable with her having more than one sexual partner in her past because I'd rationalize that I basically have no chance of being her first for anything.\n\nI think what I'm trying to say is that because she's my first for so many things, it feels somewhat disheartening to know that I might not have the chance to be her first for anything sexual. I know this problem is a personal issue and not in anyway related to her past... I just want help in perhaps rationalizing my thought train in another manner or pointing out something I might be glancing over.\n\nTL;DR:",

Data regarding serum sickness were not collected.', 'Primary outcome variables were the occurrence of immediate hypersensitivity reaction to antivenin, the type of reaction, permanent disability at hospital discharge, and mortality.', 'We identified a total of 73 patients with rattlesnake bites during the study period. Bite envenomation was graded as nonenvenomated, 7 patients (10%); mild, 23 patients (32%); moderate, 32 patients (44%); and severe, 11 patients (15%). We identified 65 patients who received antivenin. Antivenin doses ranged from 1 to 30 vials per patient (mean, 12.0 +/- 6.0), for a total of 777 vials. In 43 patients (66%), 10 or more vials of antivenin were given. The mean number of vials of antivenin given to each snakebite grade were as follows: mild, 8.4 (+/-4.0); moderate, 11.8 (+/-5.7); and severe, 18.7 (+/-6.3). No deaths, amputations, or permanent disability from snakebite occurred in the patients receiving antivenin. Acute side effects of antivenin-occurring within the first 6 hours after administration-were seen in 12 patients (18%; 95% confidence interval, 10%-30%). Acute side effects consisted solely of urticaria in all but 1 patient (2%; 95% confidence interval, 0%-8%).

If he does approach me on his own later on, I will typically have tried to detach myself from the situation and will come off as mad and have trouble genuinely reacting to his affection.

        "Write an excellent summary of the given text.\n\nTitle: my (19f) boyfriend (19m) freaks out about my gay friend (23m)\n\nText: Hi all! I'm in a bit of a pickle. My boyfriend and I have a complicated history. We were best friends for about 4 years before we started dating. We dated for 9 months before he felt he needed to break up to become closer to God and I agreed but ended up an atheist. We were in a strange limbo for about 6 months where we thought it wasn't going to work because of this difference but we found we couldn't stand to be apart so we started dating again about 3 months ago. \n\nDuring this limbo stage I met a guy on an app called vine. We became close and we gave each other our numbers so we could talk more frequently. We became super close and he helped me feel less alone during the break up and I helped him find his confidence to admit that he was gay. He's honestly one of the people I'm closest to because he lives in Ohio and I live in Florida and it's so much easier to open up to strangers than to your friends some times. (I have issues with opening up because of a weird history of suppressing my feelings so fave to face emotional talks are weird to me)\n\nThe real trouble starts when I get back together with my boyfriend. He hates my best friend. So much so that even if he sees the name pop up on my phone he gets incredibly upset at me. His biggest wish is probably that I stop talking to my friend completely, which I think is ridiculous. We're just close friends that helped each other through lonely and dark times and I don't want to stop talking to him. My boyfriend won't listen to reason and even if I tell him that he should just get over it, he flat out refuses, as if he wants to stay upset. It's gotten to the point that I have to put my friend on \"Do Not Disturb\" mode when I'm with my boyfriend so that he won't pop up on my screen and \"trigger\" him. \n\nI just want to know if I'm being unreasonable.\n\nTL;DR:",

I love her to her death and couldn't imagine life without her, but this one thing feels weird.\n\n*Background*: When she was a kid she had this huge celebrity crush on an older actor.

I mean, by the way she talks about him I wouldn't be surprised that she's masturbated to him or something. And it's not even a celebrity, it's just this guy on youtube that plays games (I thought only children watched those videos)! \n\n**My side**: I don't have any other crushes because I love *her*. I'm not interested in anyone else so why is she? \n\n**Her side**: she thinks it's weird that I'm not like her and have crushes, but obviously tries to keep me in the dark about her crushes since she knows I'm not like that.\n\nWhat would you guys/girls think?\n\nTL;DR:",

She entertained the idea for a while but then decided no, and I've been unable to move on.\n\nText: She was open to it but then changed her mind due to a mixture of miscommunications and stupid things I texted.\n\nThat was a year ago and I'm still thinking about her, unable to move on.\n\nI want to contact her again but I tried that 10 months ago and she told me I better stop or it would be stalking and harrassment (my attempt at reconciling was a compelte failure as you can see).\n\nNow today, I struggle to let go. The issue is not that I'm sad, because I was sad for many months but the sadness has basically subsided. The issue is that I still long for her every day and I still allow this fantasy of marrying her to have an effect on my life decisions. I am reluctant to make any decision that will make it difficult for her to marry me if she ever decided to reconsider her decision, and I am eager to make decisions that would make a marriage between us easy. \n\nI am just waiting for my opportunity to make things right---maybe I'll randomly run into her at the store or something, and I'll say the right things and things will go back to normal. But this is just silly-talk!\n\nAn additional detail, not sure if it is relevant or not, but we are Muslim so we don't really date or hang out frequently with people of the opposite gender. For some reason, I made an exception for her and decided to talk to her more than I would normally talk to a girl, probably because I was sure I would marry her. But, now I can see that this decision to sacrifice my values a tiny bit caused my destruction. \n\nI posted this because I am just curious about what people have to say about it, if anything at all. AMA or leave a comment, or just downvote if this is stupid.\n\nThanks for reading!\n\nTL;DR:",

He's my good friend and closer to my age at the office we work at. We're both in our very early 20's while everyone else is 30-50. Rytaur and I exchange crude content we find via reddit, 4chan, you name it via skype at the office quite often because it brightens our day as I'm sure most of you do. \n\nWell lately I've been having trouble with my email software at my office. I contacted our IT department (I could fix it myself but they could fix it for me, laziness engage) to take a look. They're located at our HQ which is somewhere in North Mexico (Canada.. they both say eh. Just saying). Anyway, we use TeamViewer to solve issues like this (TeamViewer is an application used to control/view another users computer from your own). I usually have all my windows on my screens visible so I can work and chat at the same time, one being Skype. I forgot that it was abnormal to exchange stuff that we do over Skype so I figured it wasn't a big deal if I left it open. As they started the repair process I figured I had some time to kill so I went to the bathroom and took a smoke break. That's where this goes south... I came back to Skype being wide open with 6 new links to /r/4chan posts and some pretty rough comments to follow. I think they saw it because TeamViewer is now closed and my email is still broken, they said they'll be getting back to me later in the week...\n\nTL;DR:",

We met on Facebook. He lives in Indiana, I live in Jersey. We saw each other in person about once or twice a month. Things were going very well, until he broke up with me out of the blue last February. He said the distance was too much for him as it was, and I was getting ready to deploy with my Army National Guard unit and he couldn't deal with that. So things ended. \n\nFast forward to about 2 months ago, he sent me a friend request on Facebook. I accepted. We've been talking a bunch and he's made it clear he wants to try again when I get back home in about another month. He said he was scared before and that's why he broke up with me, but he realizes now that he made a mistake. He wants to prove that he's serious about being with me. I normally don't give anybody second chances, but I'm on the fence with this. Do I go back home and date around and meet new people (I got in pretty great shape this year, so the shallow side of me does want to go out and enjoy myself), or do I return to the same relationship I was in a year ago and hope he's serious?\n\nTL;DR:",

How do I get closer to her?\n\nText: Some backstory: My friend Kelsey [22F] and I dated for a few weeks in summer before she went to Spain for a year. I was very interested in her but we both understood that she was going to be gone for a long time so our dating was just a temporary thing. We both knew this going into it. Fast forward into the year a bit and I started dating her close friend, Mary [20F]. I had been interested in her before as well but I felt she was too young for me at the time. We dated on and off for 3 years, her family hated me the entire time, especially her mother.\n\nNow Mary and I are broken up and Kelsey has helped me through it all. It's only been a week, but we've gone out to lunch, went for a hike, went rollerblading, and watched the night sky during a meteor shower, together, all within that time.\n\nI just wish I knew what to do in this situation; currently I'm just hanging out with her every chance I can get, but I'm not sure she would even remotely feel the same way about me as I do about her. I really care for her and I don't want to mess that up, but I want to have more than a friendship; even if we aren't in a relationship I want to spend a lot of my time with her and be more than just friends. I want to tell her how I feel about her and how much she has helped make my life better, but I feel like that would freak her out and make her want to stop talking to me. I'm not sure if she is hanging out with me because she sympathizes with me or because she is kind of interested in me.\n\nI suck at typing up my thoughts so please let me know if anything is unclear or you have any questions.\n\nTL;DR:",

I'm obviously hurting, and there is a lot that has to simmer down. I get it, I get the generic - move on - do you - live your life (especially since we are long distance for the most part). \n\nBut we both want to stay close, best friends. We were best friends before, during and hopefully now after. I understand how it will hurt, and that it's selfless - and that it really won't make her love me like she used to.

But I also *feel* like I still really need her friendship.\n\nI'm really hurt - got most of my anger out, but I'm almost satisfied with being best friends; because I know how young we are. It feels healthy that we're making this call now. Except I wish it was some reason about being far away - not that she just doesn't feel it.. So I'm sad, but it's inevitable. Can't make her feel something she doesn't, especially under the circumstances.\n\nAnd we both have time to live and figure things out. And in the future if it wants to work, it will. \n\nBut right now - how can we make this friendship strong right now?\n\nI may not have been that detailed, so if I can clarify anything I would really love to get talking about this.\n\nTL;DR:",

Granted, we've had amazing times without arguing.. but we do never seem to have the same opinion on anything. Money, Technology, Music, we just bicker over random stuff.\n\nAnyway, from all this I think I'm a good portion of the problem.. I just ... I'm stubborn and set in my opinions, I've always wanted to change and usually I'm not that bad, but it does get bad when I don't actively try to control it during conversation.\n\nThis leads to my current predicament. Yesterday he said that he thought it might be better if we broke up. He figures that there's someone better for him and for me... I completely disagree with this because of a few reasons. First and foremost being that I love him, but then there's also the fear of being alone, and the honest belief that he's the best man for me. \n\nSo far I've managed to convince him to give us more time. To give /me/ a few weeks to change and some time to show him how much better we can be. He's currently away with his parents getting \"space\", and still seems unhappy. \n\nSo I guess my question is, how do I proceed with this? I don't want to lose him, and I fear it might be to late to save us. I am going to try as hard as I possibly can to change and become the person I want to be for him, but in the meantime I just don't know how to keep him from saying that he just doesn't want to be with me. I feel so surprised at his feelings.. I know I should've seen them coming, but I didn't and now I fear I don't have time or a chance to fix it.\n\nTL;DR:",

Our sex life is pretty active and on the whole satisfying, though he's been a bit lazier recently due to weed.

I've always kind of had a crush on her, but because of her long distance partner, I haven't done anything.\n\nRecently she asked whether we could meet for a coffee date. The last time I spoke to her, she made reference to having difficulties with the relationship. Although I like her, I was paranoid about being used as a battering ram for relationship difficulties (one of my friendship groups literally imploded after this) any I checked her facebook page to confirm she was still in a relationship (she was) so I figured all was good. For whatever reason I reloaded that page 30 minutes later, and I saw that she had taken those details down. \n\nAgain, I was thinking fairly cautiously - specifically, they could be on a break or maybe she didn't want information about her relationship up. I went and had a coffee, although unfortunately a mutual colleague of ours was there and in the same location, so we couldn't really ignore him and I didn't get a chance to ask.\n\nI asked my brother about this situation (because her, him and I have a number of intermeshed friendships). He felt that there wasn't enough information to reach a solid conclusion on anything, so he felt that I should not do anything or at the very least approach the situation cautiously, in case things did go south.\n\nUnfortunately, I'm not sure how to do this. I'm recovering from surgery this weekend, so I have a bit more time to think about the situation. I don't want to lose my friend, but at the same time the sequence of events (at least from my perspective) felt like something was up.\n\nTL;DR:",

I stayed away for almost 6 months.\n\nThen I ran into her out of the blue at a house party.  We were friendly w each other and then we started talking about what happened. One thing led to another and we were making out.  She wanted to go walk back to her place and hook up, telling me she loves me still etc.  My red flag went off because this is how the previous 2 times we tried getting back together went.

I never really wanted to admit to myself that what I was going through wasn't a phase. I've changed in the last two years up to the point where my friends didn't recognize me anymore. I've been through a tough long distance relationship that lasted one year, and it has changed my personality. I used to be very social and extremely friendly. I was the person who made plans to go out and invited everyone, and people always knew me as outgoing and happy because I really was that way.\n\nAnd suddenly I lose all motivation to do anything. Holding a conversation with even my closest friends became a burden. I never felt like going out or meeting people anymore. I just wanted to lay down all day and sleep. I really missed the guy, but it was me who broke things up and I didn't love him anymore. It wasn't even heartbreak.\n\nThen one of my friends asked me if I was feeling okay and that I was acting depressed. See, what I believe \"depression\" to be is spoiled teenagers having a \"hard life\". But apparently it's much bigger than that. I did some research and it described exactly what I felt. However, I felt like coming out with this wouldn't be conventional as most of the people around me have the same opinion of depression as I do, and I also do not like that kind of attention.\n\nI became outright disrespectful to the people around me, very rude to my family and friends. I pretty much pushed every single person out of my life. But recently, I've become closer to a person who lives far away from me again. I think I might really like him. He makes me smile and it has changed the way I have been acting lately. I still have my moody and bitchy outbursts, but I feel like I'm a lot happier.

We acquired some acreage and are slowly developing the land to suit our needs, but it's a time consuming process. To put it into perspective, we've been spending a good portion of our weekends working on the land for the last three years and just this last year we were able to completely install all utilities and move into a cabin we all built.\n\n \n\nI'm also in a long distance relationship with a woman whom I love dearly, and just celebrated my two year with. In an attempt to facilitate our staying close I've maintained a job in my former college town where my SO lives, which is almost two hours away from my future farm. I work there four days a week and the rest of my week is spent at the property. The commute is hell, 4 hoursX4 days a week, but it lets me see her more frequently than most LDRs.\n\n \n\nRecently my father's income has been more than quartered due to falling energy prices, with him resting on the brink of unemployment. This has slowed development down immensely, and I have now stepped in deeper to pick up some of the slack with my anemic earnings. I'm now in a situation where my father and friend are putting pressure on me to spend the majority of my fleeting spare time working on our business, whilst my girlfriend pressures me to spend more of that time with her.\n\n \n\nLately when I try and spend more time on the business she feels like I'm neglecting her, and sometimes even when we're together she says my mind is elsewhere (which is sometimes true, though I've had many obligations and responsibilities from day one).

I'm 18M dating a 17F. \n\nMy girlfriend and I were set up by a mutual friend of ours about a month ago.  We both knew of each other and thought the other was attractive, but we were both too shy to do anything about it.  Needless to say, when we were set up, we didn't know each other very well.  After about a week, I thought she was pretty cool, so I asked her to be my girlfriend.\n\nAnyway, in the past few weeks, she's become terribly clingy.  She has a really shitty home life, and I think it stems from that.  Regardless of why she is the way she is, it's really annoying and a major turn off.  She texts me all the time, and if I don't reply within 10 minutes, she starts sending more and more.  She wants to be around me constantly, even going as far as to push me to disobey my parents in order to see her.  The worst part is that two weeks ago, she told me that she loved me.  That was my first major red flag.  I tried to tell her that she doesn't, but that just led to a major fight.  \n\nNormally, I would just end it, but we've had make out sessions recently that have escalated into other things of a sexual nature.  Nothing serious at all, but enough to make me think that she might think I was using her for things like that if I were to break up with her now.  Guys have been terrible assholes to her in the past, and the last thing I want to do is remember me as one of them.\n\nI still like her and think she's really cool, but I can't deal with this shit.

So her staying behind would mean the end of our relationship if she chose to do so.\n\nShe said she would start thinking about it.

I wound up nailing a great new job! \n\nSo I come back to WA to start my move, and my girlfriend tells me she decided she wanted to stay. We both cried a bit and resolved that since this was the end of our amazing run together we would have one last great weekend together and we did.

I live in NYC and  I was acquired with a startup in December, part of the contract said I would be awarded two bonuses.  The first one would be issued on May 31st and the second of which would be issued on November 30th. The only wording around the bonuses was that it is discretionary and you need to be in good standing ( not under performance review ) in order to obtain it.  About 2 weeks ago I was told that my bonus had been approved and I even had to write a document listing my accomplishments for why I was receiving the bonus so they can \"put it on file.\" A little strange, but whatever. Then last week I received an email from our finance department with an attachment, and the email states that I need to sign this attached amendment to my original offer letter and that it came directly per the CEO's request.  The amendment basically says that if I choose to leave or if I'm let go after May 31st and before November 30th then I have to pay back my May 31st bonus, even though the past six months I've worked for that bonus.\nCan this change be made to my offer letter regarding my bonuses this close to when it will be awarded?

Basically it was a rave without the drugs and partying. He explained it as an enlightening dance. I just picture people in dancing in a circle groping each other. \n\nThis is all too weird for me. I'm uncomfortable with the yoga, the package displays, the touching, the enlightening dances. It's not just a hobby or activity anymore. He's really into it. It's plastered all over his Facebook page. I don't know how to approach this with him without being so judgmental. I know I am being that way, especially because it's taking away a lot of his masculinity because of how he interacts with these people. He's just become very feminine. He doesn't act like he does when he's around me or his non-yoga friends. I don't like it.\n\nTL;DR:",

سنائی گئی سزا پر عمل درآمد کے نتیجے میں سوزوکی کیری ڈبے میں بند کر کے جلایا نہ جاتا۔اب تک تو پسند کی شادی، گھر سے بھاگ جانے اور مشکوک مراسم کے شبہے میں ہی لڑکیوں کے قتل کا رواج تھا مگر عنبرین کا قتل بربریت کا اگلا اسٹیج ہے۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>اسے جلانے کا سبب یہ ہے کہ بقولِ جرگہ عنبرین نے اپنی کسی سہیلی کو پسند کی شادی کے لیے گاؤں سے بھگانے میں بنیادی کردار ادا کیا۔حالانکہ اسے مقامی روایات کا پاس کرتے ہوئے \"بے غیرت سازش \"کا حصہ بننے کے بجائے بطور اچھی لڑکی اپنی سہیلی کی مخبری کرنا چاہیے تھی۔تاکہ عنبرین کے بجائے اصل لڑکی کو پکڑ کے زندہ جلایا جاتا۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>مگر اس جرگے نے عنبرین کو تھوڑی جلایا۔ بچیوں سے سلوک کی بابت خدائی احکامات و اسلامی روایات ، انسانی حقوق کے عالمی چارٹر ، آئینِ پاکستان اور ریاستی رٹ کو نذرِ آتش کیا ہے۔لیکن ریاست اپنی رٹ کے طرح طرح سے ریپ کی اس طرح عادی ہو چکی ہے کہ منٹو کے افسانے \" کھول دو \"کا مرکزی کردار لگنے لگی ہے۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>مگر ریاست کسی خلائی مخلوق کا نام تو نہیں۔یہ تین بنیادی ستونوں میں کھڑی عمارت ہے یعنی مقننہ ، عدلیہ اور انتظامیہ۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>کہنے کو ووٹرز لسٹ میں جتنے بھی نام درج  ہیں ان میں سے نصف خواتین کے ہیں۔چند علاقوں کو چھوڑ کے خواتین ہر انتخاب میں جوش و خروش سے حصہ بھی لیتی ہیں۔مگر ان ووٹوں کے بل پر منتخب ہونے والی مقننہ ( پارلیمنٹ) کا حال یہ ہے کہ عورتوں کے تحفظ کا جو بھی قانون بنانے کی کوشش ہوتی ہے اس پر پہلا حملہ پارلیمانی اکثریت یعنی مردوں کی طرف سے ہوتا ہے۔بادلِ نخواستہ عورتوں کے حق میں قانون سازی کرنا بھی پڑ جائے تو بل یا ایکٹ کے دودھ میں اتنی مینگنیاں ڈال دی جاتی ہیں کہ قانون سازی کا مقصد ہی پانی ہو جاتا ہے۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>مثلاً دو ہزار پانچ میں پاکستان پینل کوڈ میں ترمیم کی گئی کہ قاتل کو مقتول کے ورثا عدالت میں مقدمہ دائر ہونے کے بعد ازخود معاف نہیں کر سکتے کیونکہ اس معافی کے پیچھے لالچ اور خوف بھی کارفرما ہو سکتا ہے۔تاہم اس بابت حتمی فیصلہ جج کی صوابدید پر چھوڑ دیا گیا کہ وہ ورثا کے درمیان \"تصفئیے \" کو تسلیم کرتا ہے کہ نہیں۔ نتیجہ یہ ہے کہ پہلے کی طرح آج بھی طاقتور پارٹی \" تصفئیے \" کی سہولت اپنے حق میں استعمال کرتی ہے۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>سینیٹ نے مارچ دو ہزار پندرہ میں سینیٹر صغری امام کے پیش کردہ دو بلوں کی سال بھر غوروخوض کے بعد منظوری دے دی۔ایک بل میں اجتماعی ریپ کے لیے سخت ترین سزا تجویز کی گئی جب کہ دوسرے بل میں غیرت کے نام پر قتل کو تین سو دو کے قتل کی طرح تھرڈ ڈگری مرڈر کے خانے میں رکھا گیا۔جس کی کم ازکم سزا عمر قید یا موت تجویز کی گئی۔مگر قومی اسمبلی میں یہ بل منظور نہ ہو سکے۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>گذشتہ ماہ حکومت اور اپوزیشن میں پی آئی اے کی نجکاری سے متعلق بل کی منظوری کے عوض یہ سمجھوتہ ہوا کہ صغری امام کے دو بلز سمیت عورتوں کی سلامتی سے متعلق چار قوانین کی پارلیمنٹ کے جوائنٹ سیشن میں منظوری دی جائے گی۔تاہم اپوزیشن اور حزبِ اقتدار کے بہت سے ارکان نے غیرت کے نام پر قتل سے متعلق سخت سزاؤں پر اپنے تحفظات کا اظہار کیا تو ان بلز کی منظوری ایک بار پھر التوا میں پڑ گئی۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>سندھ اسمبلی نے مارچ دو ہزار تیرہ میں گھریلو تشدد کو جرم قرار دینے کا قانون منظور کیا۔تاہم اس پر عمل درآمد اور مانیٹرنگ کے لیے کوئی قابلِ عمل ڈھانچہ بشمول بائی لاز آج تک سامنے نہیں آ سکا۔چار ماہ قبل گلگت بلتستان اسمبلی نے سیکریٹری قانون کی جانب سے پیش کردہ کم عمری میں شادیوں پر پابندی کا بل مسترد کر دیا۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>ستم ظریفی یہ ہے کہ یہی ارکانِ پارلیمان جب اسلام آباد ، لاہور اور کراچی میں سیمیناروں سے خطاب کرتے ہیں تو ان سے بڑا عورتوں کے حقوق کا چیمپئین کوئی نہیں ہوتا۔ جب یہ سرکاری ٹکٹ پر بین الاقوامی کانفرنسوں میں شریک ہوتے ہیں تو خواتین کے حقوق کے تحفظ کے لیے ان سے زیادہ روشن تجاویز کوئی نہیں پیش کرتا۔مگر جب اپنے گاؤں میں ہوتے ہیں تو ان کی زیرِ صدارت جرگے عورتوں کی قسمت اور زندگی موت کا فیصلہ کرتے ہیں اور جب اسمبلیوں میں ووٹنگ کا وقت آتا ہے تو یہ چوڑیاں پہن لیتے ہیں۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>جہاں تک عدلیہ کا معاملہ ہے تو سپریم کورٹ کئی برس پہلے جرگے کی روایت اور جرگے کے فیصلوں کے نتیجے میں ونی ، سورا اور سنگ چٹی کی روایات کو کالعدم اور غیر قانونی قرار دے چکی ہے۔لیکن آج بھی جرگے سپریم کورٹ کے اس فیصلے کو دھڑلے سے روند رہے ہیں۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>جہاں تک اسلامی نظریاتی کونسل کا معاملہ ہے تو اگرچہ وہ ایک مشاورتی ادارے ہے اور اس کے فیصلے بائنڈنگ نہیں اور اس کا بنیادی کام یہ ہے کہ اگر پارلیمنٹ یا حکومت یا کوئی سرکاری ادارہ کسی معاملے یا مسودے پر کوئی رائے طلب کرے تو نظریاتی کونسل اس پر فقہی رائے دے دے۔ پھر یہ رائے لینے والے کی صوابدید ہے کہ وہ اس پر پورا عمل کرتا ہے یا جزوی۔لیکن پچھلے چند برس سے دیکھا جا رہا ہے کہ اسلامی نظریاتی کونسل اپنے طور پر ہر معاملے پر رضاکارانہ رولنگ دینے لگی ہے۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>کچھ معاملات ایسے بھی ہیں جن پر کونسل کے اندر بھی اتفاقِ رائے نہیں ہو سکا مگر کونسل کے چیئرمین نے ان فیصلوں ، رولنگز اور آبزرویشنز کو ایسے پیش کیا جیسے یہ اسلامی نظریاتی کونسل کی متفقہ رائے ہو۔ مثلاً یہی کہ ریپ کیسز میں ڈی این اے رپورٹ کو بنیادی ثبوت کے طور پر نہیں مانا جاسکتا ( حالانکہ کئی مسلمان ممالک ڈی این اے رپورٹ کی اہمیت مان رہے ہیں )۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>مثلاً یہی کہ انیس سو باسٹھ کے عائلی قوانین کے تحت اٹھارہ برس سے کم عمر کی شادی غیر قانونی ہے اور پاکستان میں نکاح خواں جو فارم استعمال کرتے ہیں وہ انھی عائلی قوانین کے تحت شایع کیا جاتا ہے۔مگر اسلامی نظریاتی کونسل کے چیرمین گاہے ماہے رضاکارانہ یاد دلاتے رہتے ہیں کہ عمر کی کوئی قید نہیں اور مرد کو دوسری شادی کے لیے پہلی بیوی سے اجازت لینے کی ضرورت نہیں۔چنانچہ عام آدمی کنفیوز ہو جاتا ہے کہ وہ کونسل کے چیرمین کی بات پر دھیان دے کر نافذ عائلی قوانین کو ماننے سے انکار کر دے یا پھر ان عائلی قوانین کو تسلیم کر کے چیرمین کے بقول غیر شرعی حرکت کا مرتکب ہو۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>ایک مشکل یہ ہے کہ پاکستان میں بیک وقت اینگلو سیکسن عدالتیں ، شرعی عدالتیں اور جرگہ راج چل رہا ہے۔ ان حالات میں جب عورتوں کے قتل ، غیرت ، عزت یا پسند کی شادی وغیرہ کا معاملہ آتا ہے تو حقوق کی پامالی کرنے والے کو خودبخود سہولت مل جاتی ہے کہ اگر طاقتور ہے تو جرگے کے نام پر خود ہی قانون بن جائے یا پھر گھر کی چار دیواری کے اندر ہی گلا گھونٹ کے دفن کر دے۔ چاہے تو ایس ایچ او کے مشورے سے اینگلو سیکسن عدالت کے روبرو چالان میں کمزور قانونی دفعات ڈلوا دے۔جب تک متوازی قوانین نافذ رہیں گے بے انصافی اور ظلم کا تدارک ممکن نہیں۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>بیشتر پاکستان میں انتظامیہ کا مطلب پولیس اور تھانہ ہے۔ عالم یہ ہے کہ انسانی حقوق کمیشن کے مطابق گذشتہ دو برس میں غیرت کے نام پر بارہ سو چھہتر قتل ہوئے۔ان میں سے تقریباً چار سو کیسز کی ایف آئی آرز ہی درج نہ ہو سکیں۔صرف انھی کیسزپر انتظامیہ حرکت میں آتی ہے جن پر میڈیا شور مچائے اور بالا حکام خود پر سے توجہ  ہٹانے کے لیے تحقیقات کا حکم دے دیتے ہیں۔ جیسے ہی شور کم ہوتا ہے مظلوم خاندان کو چاروں طرف سے دھونس ، دھمکی اور لالچ کے ناگ گھیر لیتے ہیں۔المیہ یہ ہے کہ جسے ہم مظلوم خاندان سمجھتے ہیں وہ بھی بعض اوقات مظلوم نہیں ہوتا۔اکثر ایسی وارداتوں میں ماں ، باپ ، بھائی ملوث ہوتے ہیں اور اپنے ہی خون کا خون کر کے ایک دوسرے کے گلے مل کے رو لیتے ہیں۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>اگر غیرت کے نام پر قتل کی سماجی روایت درست ہے تو پھر ایسا کیوں ہے کہ جو لوگ اس کے حق میں خاندانی و سماجی رواج کی دلیل لاتے ہیں اگر انھیں اپنے فعل کی صداقت پر یقین ہے تو خم ٹھونک کے کیوں نہیں کہتے کہ ہاں ہم نے قتل کیا ہے۔ ایک جانب تو تم عنبرین کو جلاؤ اور پھر اسے تسلیم کرنے کے بجائے جھوٹ بولو کہ یہ کوئی حادثہ تھا اور یہ کام ہم نے نہیں کیا۔کچھ غیرت خود کے لیے بھی تو کھاؤ۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>بات یہ ہے کہ ہم سب اندر سے شائد یہی چاہتے ہیں کہ ہمارے لڑکے دیسی مرغوں کی طرح آزاد ہوں اور ہماری لڑکیاں برائلر چکن کی طرح شیڈ میں پیدا ہوں، پنجروں میں دانہ دنکا چگتے بڑی ہوں اور پھر خاموشی سے چھری تلے آجائیں۔( اگر ایسا نہ ہوتا تو پھر اتنا لمبا مضمون باندھنے کی ضرورت ہی کیوں پیش آتی )۔</p>\n\t\t\t<p>بشکریہ ایکسپریس</p>\n\t\t</section>\n\t</body>\n",

My parents are immigrants from India, and he can trace his lineage to Ireland but it's back several generations.\n\nWhen we were in college, Sean and I went abroad to Dublin.  He fell in love with the culture, the environment, everything.  He always wanted a culture and felt that he finally knew where he came from.  After this trip, he became enamored with Irish first names.  Think Aoife, Nora, Ciaran, etc. \n\nMy culture is important to me as well.  Being Indian, I've grown up realizing that most Indians will choose to whitewash if given the opportunity.  As a kid, if my name had been Nikita, you better believe I would've been Nicki.  Thankfully my name was hard to anglicize and I grew to love it.  I was never insulted for my name either, and it was phonetically pronounced.\n\nNow that I'm expecting a baby, we're at odds when it comes to the name.  Although I kept my maiden name, the baby will have Sean's last name, which is very obviously Irish.  My husband also wants an Irish first name.  I feel like giving our child an Irish first and last name just negates the Indian side too.  I personally want an Indian first name, Irish middle, and Irish last name.  I feel that's a fair compromise.  My husband disagrees.\n\nIs there anything we can do to settle this?  Who is right here?  Is there even a solution?\n\nTL;DR:",

His good nature has cost him £5000\n\nText: I've just been to my parents and had to find out through them that my brother has gotten into money trouble because of an ex-colleague. \n\nA guy called Nathan asked my brother Paul if he could be his guarantor for a loan. I'm not good with this stuff but from what I gather, if Nathan misses a payment then it's my brothers responsibility to pay? So...Nathan is your classic smooth talker. He lays out all of his lame life issues to my brother and how all he needs is for him to sign this contract so he can get a loan that he so desperately needs to have. My brother is one of the most kind hearted, genuine people I have ever known. Nathan promises countless times that he won't miss a payment and he can pay it off quickly.\n\nSo it begins to go okay and then got worse soon after. From what I heard he was late most months and is now heading into his third month of not paying at all. He has now gone quiet.\n\nMy brother is happily married as of 2013 and had his first child, Thomas, in 2014 - the best little thing that has ever happened to our family after they lost their last child during pregnancy.\n\nThis Nathan, has moved to the north of the UK and is just completely out of sight now. I can't get to him, not like I could achieve anything that way anyway. I contacted him on Facebook and he deleted me. How am I supposed to get any sort of justice for my brother? I hate that he is just sitting there happily, not having to pay £5000 because legally he doesn't have to because the contract says so. \n\nNow my brother is losing £200 a month until it's all paid off, for nothing. This money could go to Thomas and creating memories for his early life. I hate this.\n\nI don't know why I'm really writing this but I've seen Reddit do amazing things and I'm hoping someone as a magical answer to make this all less shitty. I'm in full anger mode right now.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nTL;DR:",

        "Write an excellent summary of the given text.\n\nTitle: What are some ways to lessen the cost of more drinking water for my school?\n\nText: I am a teacher at a small private high school in Massachusetts.  In recent weeks, faculty use of the water cooler has become an issue with administration.  Many of us on the faculty carry Nalgenes and other water bottles around the school.  The faculty room is the only water cooler we have access to, and it's two stories below some of our classrooms.\n\nAdministration has responded that teachers aren't to take any of the water out of the faculty room.  It is fine to drink up during lunch or a free period, but we cannot fill up our large water bottles and bring them back to our classrooms.\n\nDepending upon each teacher's schedule (and the location of their classroom), this can be troublesome.  For example, it is not unusual for a teacher on the third floor to have classes the first four periods of the day, lunch duty in the cafeteria, and then a class following lunch before getting a free period.  Such a schedule would leave this teacher hard-pressed for an opportunity to adequately \"drink up\" between 7:30AM (the start of homeroom) and 12:25PM (the end of fifth period).  While it is now into Fall and classrooms aren't necessarily sweltering anymore, hydration is unfortunately not simply a seasonal concern.\n\nThe frustration sets in when it is okay to drink (for example) six 6-ounce cups of water (36 ounces total) in a hurry between classes, but not okay to fill up a 32-ounce Nalgene and drink it at your leisure in your classroom over the course of a morning.  At the same time, administration has a very limited budget and wants to curb those who might be using excessive amounts of water (such as filling up before they leave for the day).  Both sides have valid points, which has led to the search for a compromise.\n\nOne of my colleagues tried to calculate how much it would cost teachers out-of-pocket to defray the cost of ordering more water jugs each month.  She presented the plan and figures (such as per-teacher cost per month), but it didn't seem to get very far.  Apparently more specifics or a more feasible plan are needed.\n\nTL;DR:",

In this study, cognitive processing therapy (CPT) was administered in a Veterans Affairs (VA) posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) specialty clinic in which training and supervision were provided following VA implementation guidelines. The aim was to (a) estimate the proportion of variability in outcome attributable to therapists and (b) identify characteristics of those therapists who produced better outcomes.', 'We used an archival database of veterans (n = 192) who completed 12 sessions of CPT by therapists (n = 25) who were trained by 2 nationally recognized trainers, 1 of whom also provided weekly group supervision. Multilevel modeling was used to estimate therapist effects, with therapists treated as a random factor. The supervisor was asked to retrospectively rate each therapist in terms of perceived effectiveness based on supervision interactions. Using single case study design, the supervisor was interviewed to determine what criteria she used to rate the therapists and emerging themes were coded.', 'When initial level of severity on the PTSD Checklist (PCL; McDonald&Calhoun, 2010; Weathers, Litz, Herman, Huska,&Keane, 1993) was taken into account, approximately 12% of the variability in the PCL at the end of treatment was due to therapists.

What are relationships really like?\n\nText: **Background:** My parents (inadvertently I hope) restricted development of my social skills. We never discussed social skills, drinking, drugs, relationships or sex. The Talk: Sex is embarassing. Don't do it until you can afford children. My parents act pretty much like roommates that just happen to be married. That's what I thought romantic relationships were like until recently.  \n\nI've made very few friendships after age 14. I know I was a bad friend. No relationship experience/knowledge and have never socialized with girls. A hug at 14 is the closest I've gotten to a sexual experience. Developed social anxiety along the way (likely avoidant).  \n\n**Discovering Reddit:** I guess it's been about a year now. This was a huge wake up call for me. I started my improvement: lost about 60lbs, clothes, hair, new sport, joined a few clubs, read a few self help books etc. Basically, the low hanging fruit. But saw little improvement.\n\nI was shocked at how wrong I perceived relationships and at how much I've missed out on in the last 10 years. I didn't know people commonly had sex in high school or that it was a major part of a typical relationship. I am not sure if I would have handled discovering that information too well while trying to date. So you probably save a few girls major headaches, thanks Reddit :)\n\n**Now:** Reddit has convinced my to seek professional help for my anxiety. I was started on an SSRI and have had 6 sessions so far. So we've kinda got an idea of what is going on. I now realize how long this road back really will be. \n\nI have been struggling to set realistic goals, which is why I am here. I am still confused about romantic relationships and their benefits. What are the different style/types like? Expected behaviors or social norms for both parties? I am really looking an overview possibilities for some context.   \n\nSo I'd love anything you've got. Book suggests, previous posts, personal experiences, advice etc. Thanks\n\nTL;DR:",

A bone bruise was defined as a typical subcortical area of signal loss, with various shapes, on T1-weighted images and of increased signal intensity on T2-weighted and FIR images. The cortical bone and articular cartilage were normal in all cases, while osteochondral injuries exhibited associated bone and cartilage damage with the same abnormal MR signal intensity.

We dated for 2 and a half years before breaking up in October.\n\nI am entering my senior year in college and have been broken up with my ex-girlfriend for about 8 months now. We were fairly serious. She is going into her junior year at the same college as me. To give you guys some background, when she was 16 she moved in with me because she had significant problems at home. Then we dated until she was 19 and I was 21. She broke things off with me because she said she was unsure about other things out there.\n\nWe had talked off an on for the last 8 months while we were apart and she always told me how much she cared about me and that she still loves me. We recently met up because we are both home for summer and she told me that she just ended things with a 25 year old guy. They had been having sex since a month after we broke up. Me and this girl had lost our virginity to each other and this was her first sexual partner besides me. She's the only one I've ever been with.\n\nNow we have been seeing each other and sleeping with each other for the past week. She said that she doesn't know what she wants and that she feels awful that she hurt my feelings by being with the other guy. She tells me that she doesn't want to jump back into things because she's afraid she still hasn't gotten over the feeling that there's something else better out there.\n\nI love this girl with everything that I have and I have no idea what to do. She says that there's a chance we get back together but doesn't know when or even if it will happen. I've been having trouble getting over the fact that she was with this other guy so recently after us breaking up and so recently to today.\nI'm just lost and feeling helpless.

A significant reduction in the \"no-flow-time\", quantitatively better chest compressions and an improved quality of ventilation can be demonstrated during CPR using supraglottic airway devices (SADs). Previous studies have demonstrated the ability of inexperienced persons to operate SADs after brief instruction. The aim of this pilot study was to determine whether an instruction manual consisting of four diagrams enables laypersons to operate a Laryngeal Mask Supreme® (LMAS) in the manikin.', 'An instruction manual of four illustrations with speech bubbles displaying the correct use of the LMAS was designed. Laypersons were handed a bag containing a LMAS, a bag mask valve device (BMV), a syringe prefilled with air and the instruction sheet, and were asked to perform and ventilate the manikin as displayed. Time to ventilation was recorded and degree of success evaluated.', 'A total of 150 laypersons took part. Overall 145 participants (96.7%) inserted the LMAS in the manikin in the right direction. The device was inserted inverted or twisted in 13 (8.7%) attempts. Eight (5.3%) individuals recognized this and corrected the position. Within the first 2 minutes 119 (79.3%) applicants were able to insert the LMAS and provide tidal volumes greater than 150 ml (estimated dead space).

Now suddenly we've started chatting again, thanks to Whatsapp and FB. \n\nI always thought he was kinda cute and interesting. In the interim, I've had many relationships, one night stands, flings, boyfriends, you name it. He, on the other hand... Nope. He's never been into all that. He's never had a girlfriend.

He's never mentioned it and I've never asked.  \n\nHe is *very* shy face to face, but his text replies to me are longer than I expect, and seem quite friendly. We keep it cool, chat about regular, mundane stuff like pets and work and stuff, but he remembers strange details about me from 7 years ago that blow my mind. He remembers when I cut my foot on glass in 2009 and bled all over the place. He remembers the name of the guy I dated in 2005! He remembers all these insanely tiny details about me and it just slips in now and then, making me wonder if he... likes me? For reference, I am a confident and loud girl. I talk non-stop (and text non-stop too). I can talk about literally anything. I *am* introverted too. I need my space and make it very clear. But I'm happy around people. \n\nIn any case, I don't want a relationship or anything, but I certainly want to develop this friendship.

I've been good friends with this girl  for about 10 years, since around the start of high school. Didn't really see her as anything else, as we both had various relationships through most of school. Friends would always joke about how we'd end up getting together and it was just laughed off. Fast forward a few years, I was not long out of a serious relationship, not really sure what I'm doing, and drunkenly told friend I have feelings for her. She says she doesn't feel the same way,  which hurt me more than I expected it to, but we joke around about it, life goes on.  \n\nNormally I'd just move on and not think about it, but any time we'd go out with friends after it she'd make sure we ended up hanging around alone. I ignored this, but it confused the hell out of me, as this never happened before. Anyway, we both end up going to separate college towns and other than the occasional catchup text, I basically put her out of my mind. Recently, a few friends started making jokes again and asking about why I never ended up with this girl, I told them why but they'd still mention it, to the point it was getting on my nerves a bit. I realise most of this probably sounds like a non story but I'm just trying to give context on why this has been getting to me so much. I've stared hanging out with her a bit more again lately, and the old feelings came back, and I have a few things planned with friends that will include her in the next couple of months. This is the crux of my problem. I feel like I'd be better off not spending time around her until when, if ever, I stop  having feelings for her. At the same time, I don't want to miss out on hanging around with other friends over it. So, what do I do?\n\nTL;DR:",

I am a 23 year old female who met my 28 year old boyfriend while still in college. He was my first real relationship, and it has continued for 3 years now.\n\nWhen we met he was slightly chubby, but I had no problem with that at all. We moved in for the summer after 4 months of dating, and have continued living together since that time. At that time, when we first moved in together, he began to gain more weight. I almost didn't notice at first. Then I did and didn't like it, mostly for the health aspect. Finally, after 2 years, at Christmas he was 30 lbs overweight and still didn't seem to notice/care about his weight or its effect on me.\n\nBut now I find his weight unattractive. I don't really want to have sex with him when he looks like this, and by now I can't even remember what he used to look like when we first met. I'm afraid that this disgust towards his weight will bleed into how I treat him as a person. I'm worried that I'm simply not attracted to him anymore.\n\nI've told him I didn't find his weight attractive, and I've tried everything to help him lose weight in a positive way. Still nothing.

All animals were fed liquids for 3 days prior to procedure. The procedures were performed under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation. The flexible endoscope was passed per orally into the stomach and puncture of the gastric wall was performed with a needle knife. The puncture was extended to create a 1.5-cm incision using a pull-type sphincterotome, and a double-channel endoscope was advanced into the peritoneal cavity. The peritoneal cavity was insufflated with air through the endoscope. The spleen was visualized. The splenic vessels were ligated with endoscopic loops and clips, and then mesentery was dissected using electrocautery.', 'Endoscopic splenectomy was performed on six pigs. There were no complications during gastric incision and entrance into the peritoneal cavity. Visualization of the spleen and other intraperitoneal organs was very good.

Without being too crude, everything about me is a bit too small, and everything about him is a bit too big- and it's painful for him- as his foreskin is almost tearing at the opening of my hoo-ha (during condom-sex, the condom must have kept his foreskin in place and 'protected' it from pain).

We've been together for around three months, it's not like it's in any way certain that I'm the only person he'll ever have sex with- it's (unfortunately, but I'm a 'live-in-the-moment' person) highly likely that we won't last forever and we'll both have sex with other people in the future.

He said \"I want to be able to satisfy you\" (which I immediately assured him, he does already), and \"it's the only option\". There must be some other option. \n\nGotta be honest, there's a tiny part of me that finds this weirdly romantic- he's willing to get rid of an _extremely_ important part of his body to be able to have sex with me.

Now we get on well together and I think there could be romantic interest, but I'm terrible at reading interest from girls, always have been.\n\nHere's where it's tricky. I asked her out on a date around 4 weeks ago, and she politely declined, and thankfully it hasn't been awkward at all and in a weird way it may have even brought us closer together. She said she \"did not want to date at the moment\" which I believe is true because at the time she was about 4 months out of a 2 year relationship that ended sourly (she was cheated on basically). An even bigger factor than that though is that she was going to go to university this September, but didn't get the grades required which is why she's now staying put. \n\nSo the last couple times I've seen her since asking her out I've been nothing but normal, I'll admit I was bit bummed out about being turned down, (I really like her) but I haven't been creepy or persistent about it. When we've been together (in group settings) generally her attention has been toward me, and I've done subtle 'tests' like leaning my leg against hers to see if she's comfortable with the contact (she doesn't pull away). We laugh a lot too, and now I'm stuck wondering whether i should ask her out again, wait longer before asking, or just move on. Any and all advice appreciated!\n\nTL;DR:",

Patients who met NIH consensus criteria for bariatric surgery and whose insurance did not require a mandatory 6-month MSWM program were randomized to a MSWM program with monthly visits over 6 months (individual or group) or usual care for 6 months and then followed for bariatric surgery outcomes postoperatively. Demographics, weight, and patient behavior scores, including patient adherence, eating behavior, patient activation, and physical activity, were collected at baseline and at 6 months (immediately preoperatively and postoperatively).', \"A total of 55 patients were enrolled in the study with complete follow-up on 23 patients. Participants randomized to a MSWM program attended an average of 2 sessions preoperatively. The majority of participants were female and non-Caucasian, mean age was 46 years, average income was less than $20,000/year, and most had Medicaid as their primary insurer, consistent with the demographics of the hospital's bariatric surgery program. Data analysis included both intention-to-treat and completers' analyses. No significant differences in weight loss and most patient behaviors were found between the two groups postoperatively, suggesting that participation in a MSWM program did not improve weight loss outcomes for LAGB. Participation in a MSWM program did appear to have a positive effect on physical activity postoperatively.\"]",

My husband and I have a wonderful, loving 1-year-old GSD. We've done a lot of training with her and she's extremely well behaved, but is still, you know, a rambunctious puppy. For most of her life, she's gone to a dog park playgroup 2x a week with a local shop we love (we're boarded her with them too, and she's done great).\n\nToday I received the following note from them: \"We wanted to touch base about Shep in playgroup.  [X trainer] and [Y trainer] have both expressed concerns that she is becoming too intense, and we feel it is the best interest of the group to have her take a break.  She is not aggressive, but she often gets very focused on a certain dog and will be relentless in her pursuit of that dog.  It takes a lot of management to then keep her focus redirected, to the point that they can't give enough attention to the other dogs in the group.  We all love Shep and want to continue helping provide her with the exercise and stimulation that she needs.  We wanted to suggest going back to walks, and potentially having smaller group playtime in the back yard.  For now I will reschedule her playgroup days as walks starting next week, but please let us know your thoughts.\"\n\nI feel kind of... heartbroken, honestly. We've worked so hard with her and she's fantastic with us, as well as when we take her to the park ourselves. These playgroups have been phenomenal for her - she's great with both dogs and people because of it and is extremely friendly. I don't want to have to stop sending her, and I'm not sure what to do. Plus, both my husband and I work FT, so having her get exercise like this a few times a week has been so unbelievably helpful.\n\nDo you guys have any suggestions for behavior like this? Should we try sending her to another daycare? Is there some type of training we can/should be doing to help offset this?\n\nTL;DR:",

I do not have a problem with him watching porn (which I have assured him of) and I understand it is something to enjoy alone at times but it is really starting to bother me with how awkward and secretive he gets about it. \n\nI decided to grab a couple of drinks after work with a couple of co-workers who are also friends with my boyfriend. They began asking me questions about myself and my boyfriend attemping to get to know me better.

Various clinical conditions, such as term versus preterm gestation, first stage versus second stage of labor, and fetal heart rate (FHR) variable decelerations versus late decelerations will be tested.', \"During the study period, 113 patients were studied prospectively in either active phase of first stage (n = 53) or during the second stage of labor (n = 60). They were selected from cases exhibiting moderate to severe FHR variable decelerations or late decelerations. The fetuses of study subjects received a VAS for three seconds and FHR changes were recorded. Fetal scalp blood pH or umbilical arterial blood pH was obtained within 15 minutes of VAS. The relationship between FHR responses to VAS and fetal blood pH in term and preterm gestations, the relationship of two tests (VAS and fetal blood pH) to type of FHR decelerations, and the predictability of neonatal morbidity by two tests were analyzed. Where appropriate, Fisher's exact test (p<0.05 was considered statistically different) and the odd ratio with 95% confidence intervals were used for statistical analyses.\", 'Excellent association between acceleration response to VAS and pH>or = 7.20, and between a negative response to VAS (no acceleration or decelerations) and pH<7.20 were found in the first stage of labor, the second stage of labor, and the combination of both stages together (p = 0.0001, OR = 10.6 [3.3-34.0]). It was observed that negative VAS responses for predicting fetal acidosis (pH<7.20) were comparable between term (>or = 37 weeks) and preterm (<37 weeks,>or = 34 weeks) fetuses. Since the preterm fetuses enrolled in the study were limited in number, it is difficult to draw adequate conclusions. The positive predictive value (PPV) of fetal acidosis was 67% in both groups of FHR variable decelerations and late decelerations, but the false negative rate of acceleration VAS response for predicting no acidosis was significantly higher in the group of late decelerations (29% vs 8%, p = 0.034). Finally, both a negative VAS response and fetal acidosis (pH<7.20) have equal predictability for neonatal morbidity.

A lot of this comes from old dudes too.  \n\nIs it wrong for this to bother me?

I feel like she likes the attention and it's probably harmless but every time I know she's at the bar I get jealous that she's talking to other guys.

She goes to a different school, and I only see her when I take her out. I really like her (we have a lot in common). On both of the dates we talked the entire time. (No difficulty holding a conversation between the two of us).\nI initiate conversations over text several times a week on average. The thing is, the conversations aren't all that deep. I was texting her tonight, and she said that the playful, joking side of her isn't who she is most of the time. On our dates, it's been playful, but she's telling me she is a very mature and serious person. She sees herself as a negative person, and she uses the playful texts so she doesn't worry anyone.\nThe thing is, I haven't been starting \"deep\" conversations with her because I don't want to scare her off (our \"relationship\" [which is in no way official] is still only a few weeks old). A week or so ago she mentioned how she was going through some rough times, and I told her about how I was depressed as well (no gritty details, but I told her I was depressed, which is something I don't often admit to).\nI don't have trouble talking about myself with people I trust (like my pastor, or my best friend)... but I haven't been as forward with her because I want to have a relationship. And I guess I see spilling my guts and keeping the conversation serious all the time (for this early in courtship) as a bad thing. Basically, I want to know how to initiate \"deeper\" conversations with her. (holding them won't be an issue, we're both conversationalists).\n\nMost of our communication is via text, and she's leaving for DC (choir thing) tomorrow. Hopefully you guys will help me get a third date when she gets back monday ;)\n\nAny advice on this issue would be much appreciated. More info available on request\n\nTL;DR:",
